 * blk_mq_rdma_map_queues - provide a default queue mapping for rdma device
 * @set:	tagset to provide the mapping for
 * @dev:	rdma device associated with @set.
 * @first_vec:	first interrupt vectors to use for queues (usually 0)
 *
 * This function assumes the rdma device @dev has at least as many available
 * interrupt vetors as @set has queues.  It will then query it's affinity mask
 * and built queue mapping that maps a queue to the CPUs that have irq affinity
 * for the corresponding vector.
 *
 * In case either the driver passed a @dev with less vectors than
 * @set->nr_hw_queues, or @dev does not provide an affinity mask for a
 * vector, we fallback to the naive mapping.
