config UEVENT_HELPER
	bool "Support for uevent helper"
	default y
	help
	  The uevent helper program is forked by the kernel for
	  every uevent.
	  Before the switch to the netlink-based uevent source, this was
	  used to hook hotplug scripts into kernel device events. It
	  usually pointed to a shell script at /sbin/hotplug.
	  This should not be used today, because usual systems create
	  many events at bootup or device discovery in a very short time
	  frame. One forked process per event can create so many processes
	  that it creates a high system load, or on smaller systems
	  it is known to create out-of-memory situations during bootup.

config UEVENT_HELPER_PATH
	string "path to uevent helper"
	depends on UEVENT_HELPER
	default ""
	help
	  To disable user space helper program execution at by default
	  specify an empty string here. This setting can still be altered
	  via /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug or via /sys/kernel/uevent_helper
	  later at runtime.

config DEVTMPFS
	bool "Maintain a devtmpfs filesystem to mount at /dev"
	help
	  This creates a tmpfs/ramfs filesystem instance early at bootup.
	  In this filesystem, the kernel driver core maintains device
	  nodes with their default names and permissions for all
	  registered devices with an assigned major/minor number.
	  Userspace can modify the filesystem content as needed, add
	  symlinks, and apply needed permissions.
	  It provides a fully functional /dev directory, where usually
	  udev runs on top, managing permissions and adding meaningful
	  symlinks.
	  In very limited environments, it may provide a sufficient
	  functional /dev without any further help. It also allows simple
	  rescue systems, and reliably handles dynamic major/minor numbers.

	  Notice: if CONFIG_TMPFS isn't enabled, the simpler ramfs
	  file system will be used instead.

config DEVTMPFS_MOUNT
	bool "Automount devtmpfs at /dev, after the kernel mounted the rootfs"
	depends on DEVTMPFS
	help
	  This will instruct the kernel to automatically mount the
	  devtmpfs filesystem at /dev, directly after the kernel has
	  mounted the root filesystem. The behavior can be overridden
	  with the commandline parameter: devtmpfs.mount=0|1.
	  This option does not affect initramfs based booting, here
	  the devtmpfs filesystem always needs to be mounted manually
	  after the rootfs is mounted.
	  With this option enabled, it allows to bring up a system in
	  rescue mode with init=/bin/sh, even when the /dev directory
	  on the rootfs is completely empty.

config STANDALONE
	bool "Select only drivers that don't need compile-time external firmware"
	default y
	help
	  Select this option if you don't have magic firmware for drivers that
	  need it.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PREVENT_FIRMWARE_BUILD
	bool "Disable drivers features which enable custom firmware building"
	default y
	help
	  Say yes to disable driver features which enable building a custom
	  driver firmware at kernel build time. These drivers do not use the
	  kernel firmware API to load firmware (CONFIG_FW_LOADER), instead they
	  use their own custom loading mechanism. The required firmware is
	  usually shipped with the driver, building the driver firmware
	  should only be needed if you have an updated firmware source.

	  Firmware should not be being built as part of kernel, these days
	  you should always prevent this and say Y here. There are only two
	  old drivers which enable building of its firmware at kernel build
	  time:

	    o CONFIG_WANXL through CONFIG_WANXL_BUILD_FIRMWARE
	    o CONFIG_SCSI_AIC79XX through CONFIG_AIC79XX_BUILD_FIRMWARE

config WANT_DEV_COREDUMP
	bool
	help
	  Drivers should "select" this option if they desire to use the
	  device coredump mechanism.

config ALLOW_DEV_COREDUMP
	bool "Allow device coredump" if EXPERT
	default y
	help
	  This option controls if the device coredump mechanism is available or
	  not; if disabled, the mechanism will be omitted even if drivers that
	  can use it are enabled.
	  Say 'N' for more sensitive systems or systems that don't want
	  to ever access the information to not have the code, nor keep any
	  data.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config DEV_COREDUMP
	bool
	default y if WANT_DEV_COREDUMP
	depends on ALLOW_DEV_COREDUMP

config DEBUG_DRIVER
	bool "Driver Core verbose debug messages"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the Driver core to produce a bunch of
	  debug messages to the system log. Select this if you are having a
	  problem with the driver core and want to see more of what is
	  going on.

	  If you are unsure about this, say N here.

config DEBUG_DEVRES
	bool "Managed device resources verbose debug messages"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  This option enables kernel parameter devres.log. If set to
	  non-zero, devres debug messages are printed. Select this if
	  you are having a problem with devres or want to debug
	  resource management for a managed device. devres.log can be
	  switched on and off from sysfs node.

	  If you are unsure about this, Say N here.

config DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE
	bool "Test driver remove calls during probe (UNSTABLE)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the Driver core to test driver remove functions
	  by calling probe, remove, probe. This tests the remove path without
	  having to unbind the driver or unload the driver module.

	  This option is expected to find errors and may render your system
	  unusable. You should say N here unless you are explicitly looking to
	  test this functionality.

config DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	bool

	help
	  This option enables the framework for buffer-sharing between
	  multiple drivers. A buffer is associated with a file using driver
	  APIs extension; the file's descriptor can then be passed on to other
	  driver.

config DMA_FENCE_TRACE
	bool "Enable verbose DMA_FENCE_TRACE messages"
	depends on DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	help
	  Enable the DMA_FENCE_TRACE printks. This will add extra
	  spam to the console log, but will make it easier to diagnose
	  lockup related problems for dma-buffers shared across multiple
	  devices.

config DMA_CMA
	bool "DMA Contiguous Memory Allocator"
	depends on HAVE_DMA_CONTIGUOUS && CMA
	help
	  This enables the Contiguous Memory Allocator which allows drivers
	  to allocate big physically-contiguous blocks of memory for use with
	  hardware components that do not support I/O map nor scatter-gather.

	  You can disable CMA by specifying "cma=0" on the kernel's command
	  line.

	  For more information see <include/linux/dma-contiguous.h>.
	  If unsure, say "n".

config CMA_ALIGNMENT
	int "Maximum PAGE_SIZE order of alignment for contiguous buffers"
	range 4 12
	default 8
	help
	  DMA mapping framework by default aligns all buffers to the smallest
	  PAGE_SIZE order which is greater than or equal to the requested buffer
	  size. This works well for buffers up to a few hundreds kilobytes, but
	  for larger buffers it just a memory waste. With this parameter you can
	  specify the maximum PAGE_SIZE order for contiguous buffers. Larger
	  buffers will be aligned only to this specified order. The order is
	  expressed as a power of two multiplied by the PAGE_SIZE.

	  For example, if your system defaults to 4KiB pages, the order value
	  of 8 means that the buffers will be aligned up to 1MiB only.

	  If unsure, leave the default value "8".

	  runtime.
