	---help---
	Transport Stream Packet Processor v1 is used to offload the
	processing of MPEG transport streams from the main processor.
	It is used to process incoming transport streams from TSIF
	to supports use-cases such as transport stream live play
	and recording.
	This can also be compiled as a loadable module.
