	  specification and configure the right series of components when a
	  trace source gets enabled.

	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This driver provides support for the ETM4.x tracer module, tracing the

	  for instruction level tracing. Depending on the implemented version
	  data tracing may also be available.

config CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM
	bool "Remote processor ETM trace support"
	depends on MSM_QMI_INTERFACE
	help
	  Enables support for ETM trace collection on remote processor using
	  CoreSight framework. Enabling this will allow turning on ETM
	  tracing on remote processor via sysfs by configuring the required
	  CoreSight components.

config CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	int "default enable ETM for Remote processor based on instance id"
	depends on CORESIGHT_REMOTE_ETM
	help
	  Support for enabling separated Remote processor ETM tracing. Depends
	  on if instance id bit is set.

config CORESIGHT_QCOM_REPLICATOR
	bool "Qualcomm CoreSight Replicator driver"
	depends on CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	help
	  This enables support for Qualcomm CoreSight link driver. The
	  programmable ATB replicator sends the ATB trace stream from the
	  ETB/ETF to the TPIUi and ETR.

config CORESIGHT_DBGUI
	bool "CoreSight DebugUI driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for DebugUI that helps to capture
	  the value at a specified address. It allows configuring DebugUI
	  to select specified address and trigger mode based on user
	  input.

	select CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS
	select STM
	select CORESIGHT_OST
	help
	  This driver provides support for hardware assisted software
	  instrumentation based tracing. This is primarily used for
	  logging useful software events or data coming from various entities
	  in the system, possibly running different OSs

	help
	  This driver provides support for configuring aggregator. This is
	  primarily useful for pulling the data sets from one or more
	  attached monitors and pushing the resultant data out. Multiple
	  monitors are connected on different input ports of TPDA.

config CORESIGHT_TPDM
	bool "CoreSight Trace, Profiling & Diagnostics Monitor driver"
	help
	  This driver provides support for configuring monitor. Monitors are

	  also responsible for interaction with system cross triggering.

config CORESIGHT_TPDM_DEFAULT_ENABLE
	bool "Turn on TPDM tracing by default"
	depends on CORESIGHT_TPDM
	help
	  Turns on CoreSight TPDM tracing for different data set types by
	  default. Otherwise, tracing is disabled by default but can be
	  enabled via sysfs.

	  If unsure, say 'N' here to avoid potential power and performance
	  penalty.

config CORESIGHT_CTI
