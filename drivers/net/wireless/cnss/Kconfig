	---help---
	 This module adds support for the CNSS connectivity subsystem used
	 for wifi devices based on the QCA AR6320 chipset.
	 This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	 restart framework.

config CNSS_SDIO
	bool "Enable/disable cnss sdio platform driver for wifi module"
	depends on CNSS
	depends on MMC
	---help---
	 This module adds support for the CNSS wlan module interfaced
	 with SDIO bus.
	 This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	 restart framework, power on WLAN chip and registered the WLAN module
	 as a SDIO client device.

config CNSS_PCI
	bool "Enable/disable cnss pci platform driver for wifi module"

	---help---
	 This module adds support for the CNSS wlan module interfaced
	 with PCIe bus.
	 This driver also adds support to integrate WLAN module to subsystem
	 restart framework, power on WLAN chip and registered the WLAN module
	 as a PCIe client device.

config CNSS_ASYNC
	bool "Enable/disable cnss pci platform driver asynchronous probe"
	depends on CNSS_PCI
	---help---
	 If enabled, CNSS PCI platform driver would do asynchronous probe.
	 Using asynchronous probe will allow CNSS PCI platform driver to
	 probe in parallel with other device drivers and will help to
	 reduce kernel boot time.

config CNSS_MAC_BUG
	bool "Enable/disable 0-4K memory initialization for QCA6174"
	depends on CNSS
	---help---
	  If enabled, 0-4K memory is reserved for QCA6174 to address
	  a MAC HW bug. MAC would do an invalid pointer fetch based on
	  the data, that was read from 0 to 4K. So fill it with zero's;
	  to an address for which PCIe root complex would honor the read
	  without any errors.

config CLD_DEBUG
	bool "Enable/disable CLD debug features"
	help
	 WLAN CLD driver uses this config to enable certain debug features.
	 Some of the debug features may affect performance or may compromise
	 on security.

	  Say N, if you are building a release kernel for production use.
	  Only say Y, if you are building a kernel with debug support.

	  Runtime Power Management is supported for PCIe based WLAN Drivers.
	  The features enable cld wlan driver to suspend pcie bus when APPS
	  is awake based on the driver inactivity with the Firmware.
	  The Feature uses runtime power management framework from kernel to
	  track bus access clients and to synchronize the driver activity
	  during system pm.
	  This config flag controls the feature per target based. The feature
	  requires CNSS driver support.
