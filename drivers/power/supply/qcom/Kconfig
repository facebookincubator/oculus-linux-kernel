	  Say Y here to enable the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QGauge driver
	  which uses the periodic sampling of the battery voltage and current
	  to determine the battery state-of-charge (SOC) and supports other
	  battery management features.

	  The QPNP SMB5 charger driver supports the charger peripheral
	  present in the chip.
	  The power supply and iio frameworks are used to communicate battery
	  and usb properties to userspace and other driver consumers such
	  as fuel gauge, USB, and USB-PD.
	  VBUS and VCONN regulators are registered for supporting OTG,
	  and powered Type-C cables respectively.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called qpnp-smb5-main.

	help
	  Say Y to include the support of SMB1398 Charge driver based on power
	  supply framework.
	  SMB1398 is a combo charger chip which can work in different modes:
	  (1) DIV2 charge pump mode to work as a companion charger to be paired
	      with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.â€™s family of standalone chargers;
	  (2) DIV2 and 3-level buck combo mode to regulate the output power from
	      wireless charger receiver and provide the input for downstream
	      chargers.

config SMB1355_SLAVE_CHARGER
	tristate "SMB1355 Slave Battery Charger"
	depends on MFD_I2C_PMIC
	help
	  Say Y to include support for SMB1355 Battery Charger.
	  SMB1355 is a single phase 5A battery charger.
	  The driver supports charger enable/disable.
	  The driver reports the charger status via the power supply framework.
	  A charger status change triggers an IRQ via the device STAT pin.
