 * Common:
 *
 * Assessment of Products Returned from Field
 *
 * Returned products are considered good if they fulfill the specifications / 
 * test data for 0-mileage and field listed in this document.
 *
 * Engineering Samples
 * 
 * Engineering samples are marked with (e) or (E). Samples may vary from the
 * valid technical specifications of the series product contained in this
 * data sheet. Therefore, they are not intended or fit for resale to
 * third parties or for use in end products. Their sole purpose is internal
 * client testing. The testing of an engineering sample may in no way replace
 * the testing of a series product. Bosch assumes no liability for the use
 * of engineering samples. The purchaser shall indemnify Bosch from all claims
 * arising from the use of engineering samples.
 *
 * Intended use
 *
 * Provided that SMI130 is used within the conditions (environment, application,
 * installation, loads) as described in this TCD and the corresponding
 * agreed upon documents, Bosch ensures that the product complies with
 * the agreed properties. Agreements beyond this require
 * the written approval by Bosch. The product is considered fit for the intended
 * use when the product successfully has passed the tests
 * in accordance with the TCD and agreed upon documents.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the customer to ensure the proper application
 * of the product in the overall system/vehicle.
 *
 * Bosch does not assume any responsibility for changes to the environment
 * of the product that deviate from the TCD and the agreed upon documents 
 * as well as all applications not released by Bosch
  *
 * The resale and/or use of products are at the purchaserâ€™s own risk and 
 * responsibility. The examination and testing of the SMI130 
 * is the sole responsibility of the purchaser.
 *
 * The purchaser shall indemnify Bosch from all third party claims 
 * arising from any product use not covered by the parameters of 
 * this product data sheet or not approved by Bosch and reimburse Bosch 
 * for all costs and damages in connection with such claims.
 *
 * The purchaser must monitor the market for the purchased products,
 * particularly with regard to product safety, and inform Bosch without delay
 * of all security relevant incidents.
 *
 * Application Examples and Hints
 *
 * With respect to any application examples, advice, normal values
 * and/or any information regarding the application of the device,
 * Bosch hereby disclaims any and all warranties and liabilities of any kind,
