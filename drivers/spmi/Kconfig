	  SPMI (System Power Management Interface) is a two-wire
	  serial interface between baseband and application processors
	  and Power Management Integrated Circuits (PMIC).

	  If you say yes to this option, support will be included for the
	  built-in SPMI PMIC Arbiter debug interface on Qualcomm Technologies,

	  The Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Glink debug SPMI controller driver
	  provides an interface to read and write PMIC registers over PMIC
	  Glink using a remote subsytem (e.g. DSP).  This allows for debugging
	  PMIC peripherals that would typically only be accessible to the
	  charger and fuel gauging firmware running on the remote subsystem.
