config MHI_NETDEV
	tristate "MHI NETDEV"
	depends on MHI_BUS
	help
	  MHI based net device driver for transferring IP traffic
	  between host and modem. By enabling this driver, clients
	  can transfer data using standard network interface. Over
	  the air traffic goes thru mhi netdev interface.

config MHI_UCI
	tristate "MHI UCI"
	depends on MHI_BUS && MHI_BUS_MISC
	help
	  MHI based uci driver is for transferring data between host and
	  modem using standard file operations from user space. Open, read,
	  write, ioctl, and close operations are supported by this driver.
	  Please check mhi_uci_match_table for all supported channels that
	  are exposed to userspace.

config MHI_DTR
	tristate "MHI DTR SIGNALING"
	depends on MHI_BUS && MHI_BUS_MISC
	help
	  MHI device driver for enabling DTR<>RTS UART signaling as IP_CTRL
	  client for userspace. Data Terminal Ready (DTR) is a control signal
	  in RS-232 serial communications, transmitted from data terminal
	  equipment (DTE), or host in this case, to data communications
	  equipment (DCE), or external modem in this case to indicate that the
	  terminal/host is ready for communications and the modem may initiate
	  a communications channel.

config MHI_SATELLITE
	tristate "MHI SATELLITE"
	depends on MHI_BUS
	help
	  MHI proxy satellite device driver enables NON-HLOS MHI satellite
	  drivers to communicate with device over PCIe link without host
	  involvement. Host facilitates propagation of events from device
	  to NON-HLOS MHI satellite drivers, channel states, and power
	  management over IPC communication. It helps in HLOS power
	  savings.
