	depends on NET
	help
	  Say Y here to export rpmsg endpoints as device files, usually found
	  in /dev. They make it possible for user-space programs to send and
	  receive rpmsg packets.

config RPMSG_MTK_SCP
	tristate "MediaTek SCP"
	depends on MTK_SCP
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to enable support providing communication channels to
	  remote processors in MediaTek platforms.
	  This use IPI and IPC to communicate with remote processors.

	select RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	depends on MAILBOX
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK RPM communication driver,
	  which serves as a channel for communication with the RPM in GLINK
	  enabled systems.

config RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_SMEM
	tristate "Qualcomm SMEM Glink driver"
	select RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK
	depends on MAILBOX
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK SMEM communication driver,
	  which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
	  over SMEM.

config RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_SPSS
	tristate "QTI SPSS Glink driver"
	select RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_NATIVE
	depends on MAILBOX
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK SPSS communication driver,
	  which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
	  over SMEM. This protocol maps the smem and then shares the mapped
	  region with the remote proc by writing the smem descriptor location
	  and size into shared registers.

config RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_HELIOSCOM
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. HELIOSCOM Glink driver"
	help
		Say y here to enable support for the GLINK HELIOSCOM driver,
		which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
		over HELIOSCOM. This transport performs marshaling of GLINK commands and
		data to the appropriate HELIOSCOM format and allows for GLINK
		communication with remote subsystems that are external to the SoC.

config RPMSG_QCOM_SMD
	tristate "Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver (SMD)"
	depends on MAILBOX
	depends on QCOM_SMEM
	select RPMSG
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the Qualcomm Shared Memory Driver
	  providing communication channels to remote processors in Qualcomm
	  platforms.

config RPMSG_GLINK_HELIOSCOM_WAKEUP_MS
	int "GLINK Helioscom Wakeup timeout"
	default 0
	help
	  This option is used to configure the wakesource timeout that GLINK
	  helioscom should take when a packet is received. The glink driver can
	  guarantee that the packet gets queued to glinkpkt driver but cannot
	  guarantee the client process will get time to run if auto sleep is
	  enabled. This config will help mitigate missed packets on systems
	  where auto sleep is aggressive.

config MSM_RPM_SMD
	tristate "RPM driver using SMD protocol"
	help
	  RPM is the dedicated hardware engine for managing shared SoC
	  resources. This config adds driver support for using SMD as a
	  transport layer communication with RPM hardware. It also selects
	  the MSM_MPM config that programs the MPM module to monitor interrupts
	  during sleep modes.
