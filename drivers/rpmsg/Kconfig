	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK SPSS communication driver,
	  which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
	  over SMEM. This protocol maps the smem and then shares the mapped
	  region with the remote proc by writing the smem descriptor location
	  and size into shared registers.

config RPMSG_QCOM_GLINK_SPI
	tristate "QTI SPI Glink driver"
	help
	  Say y here to enable support for the GLINK SPI communication driver,
	  which provides support for using the GLINK communication protocol
	  over SPI. This transport performs marshaling of GLINK commands and
	  data to the appropriate SPI bus wire format and allows for GLINK
	  communication with remote subsystems that are external to the SoC.

	  RPM is the dedicated hardware engine for managing shared SoC
	  resources. This config adds driver support for using SMD as a
	  transport layer communication with RPM hardware. It also selects
	  the MSM_MPM config that programs the MPM module to monitor interrupts
	  during sleep modes.
