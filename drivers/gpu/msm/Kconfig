	  3D graphics driver for the Adreno family of GPUs from QTI.
	  Required to use hardware accelerated OpenGL, compute and Vulkan
	  on QTI targets. This includes power management, memory management,
	  and scheduling for the Adreno GPUs.

	  GPU frequency governor for the Adreno GPU. Sets the frequency
	  using an "on demand" algorithm in conjunction with other
	  components on Adreno platforms. This is not useful for non-Adreno
	  devices.
