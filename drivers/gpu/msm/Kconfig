	  3D graphics driver for the Adreno family of GPUs from QTI.
	  Required to use hardware accelerated OpenGL, compute and Vulkan
	  on QTI targets. This includes power management, memory management,
	  and scheduling for the Adreno GPUs.

	help
	  GPU frequency governor for the Adreno GPU. Sets the frequency
	  using an "on demand" algorithm in conjunction with other
	  components on Adreno platforms. This is not useful for non-Adreno
	  devices.

config DEVFREQ_GOV_QCOM_GPUBW_MON
	tristate "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GPU bandwidth governor"
	depends on DEVFREQ_GOV_QCOM_ADRENO_TZ
	help
	  This governor works together with the Adreno GPU governor to
	  select bus frequency votes using an "on-demand" algorithm.
	  This governor will not be useful for non-Adreno based
	  targets.

config QCOM_KGSL_EVENT_LOG
	bool "Enable event logging for the Adreno GPU"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL && QCOM_MINIDUMP
	help
	  A boolean flag used to enable logging of Adreno command buffer and
	  fence events to minidumps at a small performance cost. If unsure, say
	  'N' here.

config QCOM_KGSL_FENCE_TRACE
	bool "Enable built-in tracing for adreno fence timeouts"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	help
	  A boolean flag used to create a KGSL-specific tracing instance
	  under <tracefs>/tracing/instances/kgsl-fence that can be used
	  for debugging timeouts for fences between KGSL-contexts and
	  sync-point blocks. If unsure, say 'N' here.

config QCOM_ADRENO_DEFAULT_GOVERNOR

	depends on QCOM_KGSL

config QCOM_KGSL_CORESIGHT
	bool "Enable coresight support for the Adreno GPU"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL && CORESIGHT
	help
	  When enabled, the Adreno GPU is available as a source for Coresight
	  data. On a6xx targets there are two sources available for the GX and
	  CX domains respectively. Debug kernels should say 'Y' here.

config QCOM_KGSL_IOCOHERENCY_DEFAULT
	bool "Enable I/O coherency on cached GPU memory by default"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	default y if ARCH_LAHAINA
	help
	 Say 'Y' here to enable I/O cache coherency by default on targets that
	 support hardware I/O coherency. If enabled all cached GPU memory
	 will use I/O coherency regardless of the user flags. If not enabled
	 the user can still selectively enable I/O coherency with a flag.

config QCOM_KGSL_ENTRY_METADATA
	bool "Enable metadata field for KGSL memory entries"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  Adds support for the metadata field for KGSL memory entries. This can
	  be used by applications to specially mark entries in when dumping
	  'mem' for a process in debugfs. This is never required for proper
	  functioning of the driver. Say 'N' unless there is a specific need
	  for this feature.

config QCOM_KGSL_IDLE_TIMEOUT
	int
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	default 80
	help
	  GPU idle timeout for Adreno GPU. This value decides after how
	  long the GPU will go into slumber. A higher value will mean that
	  the GPU is powered ON for a longer duration which will have
	  power costs.

config QCOM_KGSL_CONTEXT_DEBUG
	bool "Log kgsl context information for all processes"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	help
	  When enabled, total number of KGSL contexts, number of attached and
	  detached contexts are dumped into kernel log for all the processes.
	  This gives insight about the number of contexts held by each process.

config QCOM_KGSL_SORT_POOL
	bool "Sort pool page list based on physical address"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	default y
	help
	  When enabled, the pool page list is sorted based on physical
	  addresses. This can be turned on for targets where better DDR
	  efficiency is attained on accesses for adjacent memory.

config QCOM_KGSL_QDSS_STM
	bool "Enable support for QDSS STM for Adreno GPU"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL && CORESIGHT
	help
	  When enabled, the Adreno GPU QDSS STM support is enabled. GPU QDSS STM
	  memory will be mapped to GPU and QDSS clock needed to access this memory
	  is voted. Debug kernels should say 'Y' here.

config QCOM_KGSL_USE_SHMEM
	bool "Enable using shmem for memory allocations"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	help
	  Say 'Y' to enable using shmem for memory allocations. If enabled,
	  there will be no support for the memory pools and higher order pages.
	  But using shmem will help in making kgsl pages available for
	  reclaiming.

config QCOM_KGSL_PROCESS_RECLAIM
	bool "Make driver pages available for reclaim"
	depends on QCOM_KGSL
	select QCOM_KGSL_USE_SHMEM
	help
	  Say 'Y' to make driver pages available for reclaiming. If enabled,
	  shmem will be used for allocation. kgsl would know the process
	  foreground/background activity through the sysfs entry exposed per
	  process. Based on this kgsl can unpin given number of pages from
	  background processes and make them available to the shrinker.
