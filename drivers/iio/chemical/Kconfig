	 Say Y here to build I2C interface support for the following
	 Atlas Scientific OEM SM sensors:
	    * pH SM sensor
	    * EC SM sensor
	    * ORP SM sensor

	 To compile this driver as module, choose M here: the
	 module will be called atlas-ph-sensor.

	help
	  Say yes here to build support for Bosch Sensortec BME680 sensor with
	  temperature, pressure, humidity and gas sensing capability.

	  This driver can also be built as a module. If so, the module for I2C
	  would be called bme680_i2c and bme680_spi for SPI support.
