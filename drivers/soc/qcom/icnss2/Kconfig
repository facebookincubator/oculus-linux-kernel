	  This module adds support for Q6 integrated WLAN connectivity
	  subsystem with iWCN architecture. This module is responsible for
	  communicating WLAN on/off control messages to FW over QMI channel.
	  It is also responsible for handling WLAN PD restart notifications.

	  Say 'Y' here to enable ICNSS driver debug support. Debug support
	  primarily consists of logs consisting of information related to
	  hardware register access and enabling BUG_ON for certain cases to aid
	  the debugging.

	  Say 'Y' here to enable ICNSS QMI support. ICNSS driver will use
	  QMI framework to communicate with WLAN FW. It will send coldboot
	  handshake messages to WLAN FW, which includes hardware capabilities
	  and configurations. It also send WLAN on/off control message to FW
	  over QMI channel.
