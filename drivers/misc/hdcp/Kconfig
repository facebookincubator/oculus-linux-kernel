          This module implements HDCP 2.2 features over external interfaces
          such as the DisplayPort interface. It exposes APIs for the interface
          driver to communicate with QTI Secure Execution Environment (QSEE)
          via the QSEECOM Driver and also communicates with the Receiver via
          APIs exposed by the interface driver.
