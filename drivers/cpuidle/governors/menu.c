/*
 * Concepts and ideas behind the menu governor
 *
 * For the menu governor, there are 3 decision factors for picking a C
 * state:
 * 1) Energy break even point
 * 2) Performance impact
 * 3) Latency tolerance (from pmqos infrastructure)
 * These these three factors are treated independently.
 *
 * Energy break even point
 * -----------------------
 * C state entry and exit have an energy cost, and a certain amount of time in
 * the  C state is required to actually break even on this cost. CPUIDLE
 * provides us this duration in the "target_residency" field. So all that we
 * need is a good prediction of how long we'll be idle. Like the traditional
 * menu governor, we start with the actual known "next timer event" time.
 *
 * Since there are other source of wakeups (interrupts for example) than
 * the next timer event, this estimation is rather optimistic. To get a
 * more realistic estimate, a correction factor is applied to the estimate,
 * that is based on historic behavior. For example, if in the past the actual
 * duration always was 50% of the next timer tick, the correction factor will
 * be 0.5.
 *
 * menu uses a running average for this correction factor, however it uses a
 * set of factors, not just a single factor. This stems from the realization
 * that the ratio is dependent on the order of magnitude of the expected
 * duration; if we expect 500 milliseconds of idle time the likelihood of
 * getting an interrupt very early is much higher than if we expect 50 micro
 * seconds of idle time. A second independent factor that has big impact on
 * the actual factor is if there is (disk) IO outstanding or not.
 * (as a special twist, we consider every sleep longer than 50 milliseconds
 * as perfect; there are no power gains for sleeping longer than this)
 *
 * For these two reasons we keep an array of 12 independent factors, that gets
 * indexed based on the magnitude of the expected duration as well as the
 * "is IO outstanding" property.
 *
 * Repeatable-interval-detector
 * ----------------------------
 * There are some cases where "next timer" is a completely unusable predictor:
 * Those cases where the interval is fixed, for example due to hardware
 * interrupt mitigation, but also due to fixed transfer rate devices such as
 * mice.
 * For this, we use a different predictor: We track the duration of the last 8
 * intervals and if the stand deviation of these 8 intervals is below a
 * threshold value, we use the average of these intervals as prediction.
 *
 * Limiting Performance Impact
 * ---------------------------
 * C states, especially those with large exit latencies, can have a real
 * noticeable impact on workloads, which is not acceptable for most sysadmins,
 * and in addition, less performance has a power price of its own.
 *
 * As a general rule of thumb, menu assumes that the following heuristic
 * holds:
 *     The busier the system, the less impact of C states is acceptable
 *
 * This rule-of-thumb is implemented using a performance-multiplier:
 * If the exit latency times the performance multiplier is longer than
 * the predicted duration, the C state is not considered a candidate
 * for selection due to a too high performance impact. So the higher
 * this multiplier is, the longer we need to be idle to pick a deep C
 * state, and thus the less likely a busy CPU will hit such a deep
 * C state.
 *
 * Two factors are used in determing this multiplier:
 * a value of 10 is added for each point of "per cpu load average" we have.
 * a value of 5 points is added for each process that is waiting for
 * IO on this CPU.
 * (these values are experimentally determined)
 *
 * The load average factor gives a longer term (few seconds) input to the
 * decision, while the iowait value gives a cpu local instantanious input.
 * The iowait factor may look low, but realize that this is also already
 * represented in the system load average.
 *
