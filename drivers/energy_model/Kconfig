	  The Energy Aware Scheduler (EAS) used to rely on Energy Models
	  (EMs) statically defined in the Device Tree. More recent
	  versions of EAS now rely on the EM framework to get the power
	  costs of CPUs.

	  This driver reads old-style static EMs in DT and feeds them in
	  the EM framework, hence enabling to use EAS on platforms with
	  old DT files. Since EAS now uses only the active costs of CPUs,
	  the cluster-related costs and idle-costs of the old EM are
	  ignored.

	  If in doubt, say N.
