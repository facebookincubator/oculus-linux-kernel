* Add a DPAA2 MAC kernel driver in order to allow PHY management; currently
  the DPMAC objects and their link to DPNIs are handled by MC internally
  and all PHYs are seen as fixed-link
* add more debug support: decide how to expose detailed debug statistics,
  add ingress error queue support
* MC firmware uprev; the DPAA2 objects used by the Ethernet driver need to
  be kept in sync with binary interface changes in MC
* refine README file
* cleanup

NOTE: None of the above is must-have before getting the DPAA2 Ethernet driver
out of staging. The main requirement for that is to have the drivers it
depends on, fsl-mc bus and DPIO driver, moved to drivers/bus and drivers/soc
respectively.
