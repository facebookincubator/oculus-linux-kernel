 * subsequent fragment subelements.
 * @defragbuff_maxsize: Maximum size of defragbuff. This is inapplicable and
 * ignored if inline_defrag is true. The size should be large enough to contain
 * the entire defragmented payload, otherwise an error will be returned.
 * @defragpayload_len: Pointer to the location where the length of the
 * defragmented payload should be updated. Irrespective of whether inline_defrag
 * is true or false, this will not include the sizes of the headers of the lead
 * subelement and subsequent fragments. Please note standards related limitation
 * given in function description below.
 *
 * Defragment a sequence of subelement fragments. If the source buffer does not
 * contain a subelement fragment sequence (in the beginning), the function
 * returns an error. The containing element is required to have already been
 * defragmented. An inline mode is available to carry out the defragmentation
 * within the source buffer in order to reduce buffer requirements and to
 * eliminate memory copies/moves for the lead subelement. In the inline mode,
 * the buffer content (if any) after the fragments is moved as well. The
 * contents of the defragmented payload are intended for end consumption by
 * control path protocol processing code within the driver in a manner uniform
 * with other protocol data in byte buffers, and not for onward forwarding to
 * other subsystems or for intrusive specialized processing different from other
 * protocol data. Hence zero copy methods such as network buffer fragment
 * processing, etc. are not used in this use case.  Additionally, this API is
 * intended for use cases where the nature of the payload is complex and it is
 * infeasible for the caller to skip the (un-defragmented) fragment boundaries
 * on its own in a scalable and maintainable manner.  Separately, please note a
 * limitation arising from the standard wherein if the caller passes a truncated
 * maximum buffer size such that the buffer ends prematurely just at the end of
 * a fragment subelement with length 255, the function will have to conclude
 * that the last successfully parsed fragment subelement is the final one in the
 * fragment sequence, and return results accordingly. If another fragment
 * actually exists beyond the given buffer, this function cannot detect the
 * condition since there is no provision in the standard to indicate a total
 * fragment sequence size in one place in the beginning or anywhere else. Hence
 * the caller should take care to provide the complete buffer with the max size
 * set accordingly.
 *
 * Return: QDF_STATUS_SUCCESS in the case of success, QDF_STATUS value giving
 * the reason for error in the case of failure
