Oculus Virtual Sensor Driver
============================

This driver implements a virtual temperature sensor. It estimates the temperature of
a region of a device without a physical thermistor via a linear combination of present
physical thermistors.

The driver registers with the thermal framework as a thermal sensor and can
be configured as the sensor associated with a thermal zone defined in the device
tree.

The driver can support alternate calculations based on whether the device is charging
or not via the defining of separate sets of values for each case.

It has an optional fault detection feature that can detect a faulty component thermistor and
replace the reading with an estimate generated using a highly correlated thermistor. The estimate
is created by a coefficient-intercept calculation similar to how the main calculation is performed.

Virtual Sensor Calculation
--------------------------

The virtual sensor temperature at time t is a linear combination of
the intercept constant, sensor temperatures at time t, and the
slope of sensor temperatures. Where the slope is defined as
sensor(t) - sensor(t-1)

VirtualSensor(t) = intercept + sensor1_coefficient*sensor1(t) + ...
  + sensorN_coefficient*(t) +
  sensor1_slopeCoefficient*( sensor1(t) - sensor1(t-1) ) + ...
  + sensorN_slopeCoefficient*( sensorN(t) - sensorN(t-1) )

Virtual Sensor Node
-------------------

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "oculus,virtual-sensor".
- #thermal-sensor-cells : Required by thermal framework, should be 0.

- thermal-zones : String list of the names of component thermal zones.

- coefficients : Child node with holding the "charging" and "discharging" blocks.
  - charging : Child node representing the values to be used when the device is charging.
        - tz-coefficients : List of numerical values to multiply the thermal zone readings by.
                Must align with `thermal-zones`.
        - (optional) tz-slope-coefficients : List of numerical values to multiply the
                previously gathered thermal zone readings by. Must align with `thermal-zones`.
                Default 0 if not defined.
        - intercept : Value to add to the final calculation.
  - discharging : Child node representing the values to be used when the device is discharging.
        - tz-coefficients : List of numerical values to multiply the thermal zone readings by.
                Must align with `thermal-zones`.
        - (optional) tz-slope-coefficients : List of numerical values to multiply the
                previously gathered thermal zone readings by. Must align with `thermal-zones`.
                Default 0 if not defined.
        - intercept : Value to add to the final calculation.

Optional properties:
- thermal-zone-scaling-factors : List of values to multiply the readings returned from component
        thermal zones by before use, in order to assure unit coherence. Default 1 if not defined.

- fallback-thermal-zone : A thermal zone to use in lieu of the virtual sensor calculation in case
        the calculation varies too widely from this zone. Not used if undefined.
- fallback-thermal-zone-scaling-factor : Value to multiply the reading returned by
        `fallback-thermal-zone` in order to assure unit coherence. Default 1 if not defined.
        Requires definition of `fallback-thermal-zone`.
- fallback-tolerance : Gap between the calculation and reading returned by `fallback-thermal-zone`
        considered acceptable. Gaps exceeding this value in either direction will return the
        reading from `fallback-thermal-zone` rather than the calculated value. Requires definition
        of `fallback-thermal-zone`.

- thermal-zone-fault-estimator-bounds : Length-2 list of values representing the range in which
        a component thermistor should be considered functional. If a component thermal zone returns
        a reading outside this range, it will be replaced with an estimate as configured by
        `thermal-zone-fault-estimator-zones` and `thermal-zone-fault-estimator-values`. Definition
        enables fault detection feature and requires definition of the aforementioned properties.
- thermal-zone-fault-estimator-zones : String list of the names of thermal zones to be used as
        estimators in the case where the associated thermal zone is considered faulty. Estimator
        zones are considered associated with the zones they align with in the `thermal-zones`
        property. If the feature is enabled, but a component zone will not use an estimator, the
        list entry should be "NA". Requires definition of `thermal-zone-estimator-bounds` and
        `thermal-zone-fault-estimator-values`.
- thermal-zone-fault-estimator-values : List of length-2 lists of values representing
        coefficient-intercept pairs for each estimator zone. Must align with `thermal-zones` and
        `thermal-zone-fault-estimator-zones`. Requires definition of `thermal-zone-estimator-bounds`
        and `thermal-zone-fault-estimator-values`.
