	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver"
	default n
	help
	  Like seqfile, this driver provides file operations to
	  easily implement a chardev backed by a kfifo.

	  Drivers using this chardev only have to call one of the
	  send() functions to deliver events to userspace.

config MISCFIFO_SAMPLE
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver example"

	help
	  Example usage of miscfifo chardev driver

config MOLOKINI
	tristate "Molokini usbpd driver"
	default n
	help
	  Molokini usbpd kernel module for registering unstructured vdm messages.
	  Messages will be sent with host device acting as a source and a sink to
	  Molokini.
	  Also creates debugfs nodes to advertise Molokini battery parameters.

config OCULUS_HOLLYWOOD

	  Enable support for the unknown2 device

config VENDOR_DT_OUTPUT_DISABLE
	bool "Disable building of device trees for test platforms"
	default y
	help
	  Building Qualcomm kernels with default flags causes serveral unrelated
	  device-trees to be built by default. Don't build them when
	  VENDOR_DT_OUTPUT_DISABLE is set since we don't need any of these on Meta
	  platforms.

config RT600_CTRL
	tristate "Oculus RT600 control driver"
	default n
	help
	    Enable RT600 control driver. This driver controls RT600 state
		for flashing and reset. RT600 state needs to be modified via
		sysfs to enable testing of different state transitions and also
		to ensure RT600 is in the correct state for flashing.

config SENSORS_PWM_TACH_FAN
	tristate "PWM&TACH fan"
	depends on (PWM && OF) || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for fans connected to PWM lines.
	  Tach connected to SoC gpio to read fan rpm.
	  The driver uses the generic PWM interface, thus it will work on a
	  variety of SoCs.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pwm-tach-fan.

config SPI_STP
	tristate "STP SPI driver"
	depends on SPI
	default n
	help
	  Enable STP SPI driver for data transfer between SoC (master) and slave.
