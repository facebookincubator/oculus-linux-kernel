config AS5510
	tristate "AS5510 Hall Effect Sensor i2c driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  This driver sets up a regmap to read sensor values.

	  With this sensor, can measure IPD. Look at regs 0x0-0x1.
	  Here is spec sheet:
	  http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/588/AS5510_Datasheet_EN_v3-272817.pdf

config BATTERY_VIRTUAL_SENSOR
	tristate "Battery Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the
	  battery temperature of a device.

config BLU_FW
	tristate "Support BLU FW Updates"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  Allow automatic/OTA FW updates for the backlight MCU.

config DISPLAY_VIRTUAL_SENSOR
	tristate "Display Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the
	  display temperature of a device.

config FRONT_PANEL_SENSOR
	tristate "Front Panel Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the front
	  panel skin temperature of a device.

config IIO_CHANNEL_SENSOR
	tristate "IIO Channel Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the iio channel
	  value of a device.

config MISCFIFO
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  Like seqfile, this driver provides file operations to
	  easily implement a chardev backed by a kfifo.

	  Drivers using this chardev only have to call one of the
	  send() functions to deliver events to userspace.

config MISCFIFO_SAMPLE
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver example"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  Example usage of miscfifo chardev driver

config MOLOKINI
	tristate "Molokini usbpd driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  Molokini usbpd kernel module for registering unstructured vdm messages.
	  Messages will be sent with host device acting as a source and a sink to
	  Molokini.
	  Also creates debugfs nodes to advertise Molokini battery parameters.

config OCULUS
	bool "Oculus feature support"
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable support for Oculus drivers and features

config OCULUS_HOLLYWOOD
	bool "Enable support for hollywood device"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select ARCH_KONA
	---help---
	  Enable support for the hollywood device

config INSTRUCTION_SAMPLER
	tristate "Periodic instruction sampler"
	depends on OCULUS && EVENT_TRACING && CONTEXT_SWITCH_TRACER && ARM64
	help
	  Provides support for periodic instruction sampling of processes
	  running on the system.

config RT600_CTRL
	tristate "Oculus RT600 control driver"
	depends on OCULUS
	default n
	help
	    Enable RT600 control driver. This driver controls RT600 state
		for flashing and reset. RT600 state needs to be modified via
		sysfs to enable testing of different state transitions and also
		to ensure RT600 is in the correct state for flashing.

config TOP_PANEL_SENSOR
	tristate "Top Panel Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the top
	  panel skin temperature of a device.

config SENSORS_PWM_TACH_FAN
	tristate "PWM&TACH fan"
	depends on (PWM && OF) || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  If you say yes here you get support for fans connected to PWM lines.
	  Tach connected to SoC gpio to read fan rpm.
	  The driver uses the generic PWM interface, thus it will work on a
	  variety of SoCs.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called pwm-tach-fan.

config SPI_STP
	tristate "STP SPI driver"
	depends on OCULUS && SPI
	default n
	help
	  Enable STP SPI driver for data transfer between SoC (master) and slave.
	  This driver implements the STP protocol on top of the SPI bus,
	  to facilitate communication between MCU and SoC. Driver supports up to 32
	  pre-configured STP channels. Each STP channel is exposed as a dedicated
	  character device, interfaceable through syscalls

config SYNCBOSS
	tristate "Oculus SyncBoss Driver"
	depends on OCULUS && MISCFIFO && SPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Oculus SyncBoss Driver

config SYNCBOSS_CAMERA_CONTROL
	bool "Support Syncboss camera control"
	depends on OCULUS && SYNCBOSS
	default y
	---help---
	  Allow Syncboss driver to control camera hardware

config VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	tristate "Virtual Sensor Utilities"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  This driver implements virtual thermal sensor helper functionality.
