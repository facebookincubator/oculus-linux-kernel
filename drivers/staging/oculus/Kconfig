config AS5510
	tristate "AS5510 Hall Effect Sensor i2c driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  This driver sets up a regmap to read sensor values.

	  With this sensor, can measure IPD. Look at regs 0x0-0x1.
	  Here is spec sheet:
	  http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/588/AS5510_Datasheet_EN_v3-272817.pdf

config BATTERY_VIRTUAL_SENSOR
	tristate "Battery Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the
	  battery temperature of a device.

config DEPTH_PROJECTOR
	tristate "Depth Projector Kernel Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  Depth Projector Kernel Module to set default gpio values.
	  This driver sets SWD_IO and SWD_CLK to high impedance mode

config FRONT_PANEL_SENSOR
	tristate "Front Panel Virtual Sensor Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	select VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	help
	  This driver implements a virtual sensor driver representing the front
	  panel skin temperature of a device.

config HYPERVISOR_GUEST
	tristate "Hypervisor Guest Kernel Module"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  Hypervisor Guest Kernel Module responsible for mapping memory, issuing
	  hypercalls, and exposing an IOCTL interface to user mode.
	  During boot the driver claims ownership of device memory, as specified
	  in the device tree. These regions provide intermediate physical address
	  space that can in turn contain mappings for circular queues and other
	  IPC structures.
	  The driver also installs an interrupt handler to handle port wake-ups
	  posted by the hypervisor.

config MISCFIFO
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  Like seqfile, this driver provides file operations to
	  easily implement a chardev backed by a kfifo.

	  Drivers using this chardev only have to call one of the
	  send() functions to deliver events to userspace.

config MISCFIFO_SAMPLE
	tristate "miscfifo chardev driver example"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  Example usage of miscfifo chardev driver

config MOLOKINI
	tristate "Molokini usbpd driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  Molokini usbpd kernel module for registering unstructured vdm messages.
	  Messages will be sent with host device acting as a source and a sink to
	  Molokini.
	  Also creates debugfs nodes to advertise Molokini battery parameters.

config NAUTILUS_CLK
	tristate "NAUTILUS CLK CONTROL Kernel Driver"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	help
	  Use GPIO 108 for the clock

config OCULUS
	bool "Oculus feature support"
	default y
	---help---
	  Enable support for Oculus drivers and features

config SYNCBOSS
	tristate "Oculus SyncBoss Driver"
	depends on OCULUS && MISCFIFO && SPI
	default y
	---help---
	  Oculus SyncBoss Driver

config SYNCBOSS_CAMERA_CONTROL
	bool "Support Syncboss camera control"
	depends on OCULUS && SYNCBOSS
	default y
	---help---
	  Allow Syncboss driver to control camera hardware

config VIRTUAL_SENSOR_UTILS
	tristate "Virtual Sensor Utilities"
	default n
	depends on OCULUS
	---help---
	  This driver implements virtual thermal sensor helper functionality.
