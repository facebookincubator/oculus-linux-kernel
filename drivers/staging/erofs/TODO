EROFS is still working in progress, thus it is not suitable
for all productive uses. play at your own risk :)

TODO List:
 - add the missing error handling code
   (mainly existed in xattr and decompression submodules);

 - finalize erofs ondisk format design  (which means that
   minor on-disk revisions could happen later);

 - documentation and detailed technical analysis;

 - general code review and clean up
   (including confusing variable names and code snippets);

 - support larger compressed clustersizes for selection
   (currently erofs only works as expected with the page-sized
    compressed cluster configuration, usually 4KB);

 - support more lossless data compression algorithms
   in addition to LZ4 algorithms in VLE approach;

 - data deduplication and other useful features.

erofs-mkfs (preview version) binaries for i386 / x86_64 are available at:

   https://github.com/hsiangkao/erofs_mkfs_binary

It is still in progress opening mkfs source code to public,
in any case an open-source mkfs will be released in the near future.
