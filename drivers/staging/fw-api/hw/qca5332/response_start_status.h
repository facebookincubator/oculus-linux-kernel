/* Description		GENERATED_RESPONSE

			The generated response frame
			
			<enum 0 selfgen_ACK> TXPCU generated an ACK response. Note
			 that this can be part of a trigger response. In that case
			 bit trig_response_related will be set as well.
			
			<enum 1 selfgen_CTS> TXPCU generated an CTS response. Note
			 that this can be part of a trigger response. In that case
			 bit trig_response_related will be set as well.
			
			<enum 2 selfgen_BA> TXPCU generated a BA response. Note 
			that this can be part of a trigger response. In that case
			 bit trig_response_related will be set as well.
			
			<enum 3 selfgen_MBA> TXPCU generated an M BA response. Note
			 that this can be part of a trigger response. In that case
			 bit trig_response_related will be set as well.
			
			<enum 4 selfgen_CBF> TXPCU generated a CBF response. Note
			 that this can be part of a trigger response. In that case
			 bit trig_response_related will be set as well.
			
			<enum 5 selfgen_other_trig_response>
			TXPCU generated a trigger related response of a type not
			 specified above. Note that in this case bit trig_response_related
			 will be set as well. 
			
			This e-num will also be used when TXPCU has been programmed
			 to overwrite it's own self gen response generation, and
			 wait for the response to come from SCH..
			Also applicable for basic trigger response. 
			
			<enum 6 selfgen_NDP_LMR> TXPCU generated a self-gen NDP 
			followed by a self-gen LMR for the ranging NDPA followed
			 by NDP received by RXPCU.
