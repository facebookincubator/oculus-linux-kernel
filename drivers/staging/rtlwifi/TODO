TODO:
- find and remove code blocks guarded by never set CONFIG_FOO defines
- convert any remaining unusual variable types
- find codes that can use %pM and %Nph formatting
- checkpatch.pl fixes - most of the remaining ones are lines too long. Many
  of them will require refactoring
- merge Realtek's bugfixes and new features into the driver
- address any reviewers comments

Please send any patches to Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>,
and Larry Finger <Larry.Finger@lwfinger.net>.
