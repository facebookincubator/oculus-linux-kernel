Mediatek Gigabit Switch
=======================

The mediatek gigabit switch can be found on Mediatek SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "mediatek,mt7620-gsw", "mediatek,mt7621-gsw",
  "mediatek,mt7623-gsw"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts: Should contain the gigabit switches interrupt


Additional required properties for ARM based SoCs:
- mediatek,reset-pin: phandle describing the reset GPIO
- clocks: the clocks used by the switch
- clock-names: the names of the clocks listed in the clocks property
  these should be "trgpll", "esw", "gp2", "gp1"
- mt7530-supply: the phandle of the regulator used to power the switch
- mediatek,pctl-regmap: phandle to the port control regmap. this is used to
  setup the drive current


Optional properties:
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device

Example:

gsw: switch@1b100000 {
	compatible = "mediatek,mt7623-gsw";
	reg = <0 0x1b110000 0 0x300000>;

	interrupt-parent = <&pio>;
	interrupts = <168 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;

	clocks = <&apmixedsys CLK_APMIXED_TRGPLL>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_ESW>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_GP2>,
		 <&ethsys CLK_ETHSYS_GP1>;
	clock-names = "trgpll", "esw", "gp2", "gp1";

	mt7530-supply = <&mt6323_vpa_reg>;

	mediatek,pctl-regmap = <&syscfg_pctl_a>;
	mediatek,reset-pin = <&pio 15 0>;

	status = "okay";
};
