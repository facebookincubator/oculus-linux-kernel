* CoreSight Components

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
specification and can be connected in various topologies to suite a particular
SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as sinks,
links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows through the
intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected sink. Each
CoreSight component device should use these properties to describe its hardware
characteristcs.
