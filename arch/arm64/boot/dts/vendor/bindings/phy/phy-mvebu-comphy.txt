mvebu comphy driver
-------------------

A comphy controller can be found on Marvell Armada 7k/8k on the CP110. It
provides a number of shared PHYs used by various interfaces (network, sata,
usb, PCIe...).

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "marvell,comphy-cp110"
- reg: should contain the comphy register location and length.
- marvell,system-controller: should contain a phandle to the
                             system controller node.
- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.

A sub-node is required for each comphy lane provided by the comphy.

Required properties (child nodes):

- reg: comphy lane number.
- #phy-cells : from the generic phy bindings, must be 1. Defines the
               input port to use for a given comphy lane.

Example:

	cpm_comphy: phy@120000 {
		compatible = "marvell,comphy-cp110";
		reg = <0x120000 0x6000>;
		marvell,system-controller = <&cpm_syscon0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		cpm_comphy0: phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};

		cpm_comphy1: phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			#phy-cells = <1>;
		};
	};
