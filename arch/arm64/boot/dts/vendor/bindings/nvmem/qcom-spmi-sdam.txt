Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Shared Direct Access Memory (SDAM)

The SDAM provides scratch register space for the PMIC clients.
This memory can be used by software to store information or communicate
to/from the PBUS.

Below are the DT bindings for this module

Supported properties:

- compatible
  Usage:	required
  Value type:	<string>
  Definition:	Should be "qcom,spmi-sdam"

- reg
  Usage:	required
  Value type:	<prop-encoded-array>
  Definition:	The base address and size of the sdam peripheral.

- Data cells
  Usage:	required
  Value type:	Subnodes with bindings described in bindings/nvmem/nvmem.txt.
  Definition:	Cells defining the shared memory usage and configuration.

Example:

	sdam_1: sdam@b000 {
		compatible = "qcom,spmi-sdam";
		reg = <0xb000 0x100>;

		....
		/* Data cells */
		restart_reason: restart@50 {
			reg = <0x50 0x1>;
			bits = <7 2>;
		};
	};

= Data consumers =
Are device nodes which consume nvmem data cells.

Example:

	{
		...
		nvmem-cells = <&restart_reason>;
		nvmem-cell-names = "pmic_restart_reason";
	};
