description: |
  Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Flash LED supports camera flash with
  multiple LED channels (HW dependent) that can be used for multiple
  camera devices which can be configured for pre-flash(torch) and
  flash modes.

  Flash LED device has two level of nodes. The main node represents
  flash LED peripheral and sub node represents the type of device
  that uses flash LED channel. It can be a torch, flash or switch.
