Awinic. AW2016 LED

AW2016 LED device supports 3 LED channels and the driver
register each channel as a single LED class device and
exports interfaces to update brightness, set timer trigger
and enable HW based blink functionalities.

- compatible

	when breath function is enabled.

- awinic,fall-time-ms
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: The duration of the led ramping down from maximum brightness
	to 0 when breath function is enabled.

- awinic,off-time-ms
  Usage: required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: The duration of the led staying at 0 brightness when breath
	function is enabled.
