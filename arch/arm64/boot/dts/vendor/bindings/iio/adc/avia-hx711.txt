* AVIA HX711 ADC chip for weight cells
  Bit-banging driver

Required properties:
 - compatible:	Should be "avia,hx711"
 - sck-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for the clock
 - dout-gpios:	Definition of the GPIO for data-out
		See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt
 - avdd-supply:	Definition of the regulator used as analog supply

Optional properties:
 - clock-frequency:	Frequency of PD_SCK in Hz
			Minimum value allowed is 10 kHz because of maximum
			high time of 50 microseconds.

Example:
weight {
	compatible = "avia,hx711";
	sck-gpios = <&gpio3 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	dout-gpios = <&gpio0 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	avdd-suppy = <&avdd>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
};
