QPNP Qnovo5 pulse engine

QPNP Qnovo5 is a PBS based pulse charging engine which works in tandem with the
QPNP SMB5 Charger device. It configures the QPNP SMB5 charger to
charge/discharge as per pulse characteristics.

The QPNP Qnovo5 pulse engine has a single peripheral assigned to it.

Properties:
- compatible:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: It must be "qcom,qpnp-qnovo5".

- reg:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Specifies the base address of the module. Qnovo5 is using a
		SDAM peripheral so this is the address of the SDAM module
		being used.

- interrupts:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Specifies the interrupt associated with Qnovo5.

- interrupt-names:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Specifies the interrupt name for Qnovo5. There is only one
		interrupt named as "ptrain-done".

- pinctrl-N:
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: Specifies the pinctrl configuration that needs to be applied
		when the charger is removed for controlling external FET.

- pinctrl-names:
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Specifies the names for pinctrl configurations defined above.
		Allowed names are "q_state1" and "q_state2".

Example:

qcom,qpnp-qnovo@b000 {
	compatible = "qcom,qpnp-qnovo5";
	reg = <0xb000 0x100>;
	interrupts = <0x2 0xb0 0x1 IRQ_TYPE_NONE>;
	interrupt-names = "ptrain-done";
	pinctrl-names = "q_state1", "q_state2";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qnovo_fet_ctrl_state1>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qnovo_fet_ctrl_state2>;
};
