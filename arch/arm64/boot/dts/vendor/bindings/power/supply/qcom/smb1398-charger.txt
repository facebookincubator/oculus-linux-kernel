Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SMB1398 Charger Specific Bindings

SMB1398 combo charge chip can be working in different modes:
(1) DIV2 charge pump mode to work as a companion charger that can be paired
    with Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. family of standalone chargers;
(2) DIV2 and 3-level buck combo mode to regulate output power from wireless
    charger receiver and provide input power for downstream chargers.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

SMB1398 Charger must be described in two levels of device nodes.

==================================
First Level Node - SMB1398 Charger
==================================

Charger specific properties:
- compatible
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: "qcom,smb1396-div2-cp-master" for SMB1396 working in DIV2
	      mode as a companion master charger.
	      "qcom,smb1396-div2-cp-slave" for SMB1396 working in DIV2
	      mode as a companion slave charger.
	      "qcom,smb1398-pre-regulator" for SMB1398 working in combo
	      mode (auto transition between DIV2 CP and 3-level buck) as a
	      pre-regulator stand between wireless receiver and downstream
	      chargers.

- interrupts
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Peripheral interrupt specifier. This is required when SMB1396
	      working as a DIV2 CP master.

- interrupt-names
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <stringlist>
  Definition: Interrupt names.  This list must match up 1-to-1 with the
	      interrupts specified in the 'interrupts' property. This is
	      required when SMB1396 working as a DIV2 CP master.

- io-channels
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <phandle-array>
  Definition: IIO channel specifiers for each name in io-channel-names.
	      For other details about IIO bindings see:
	             Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/iio-bindings.txt
	      These properties are required when SMB1396 working as a DIV2 CP
	      master.

- io-channel-names
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <string-array>
  Definition: Names of the IIO channels that are used by CP master.

- qcom,div2-cp-min-ilim-ua
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: The minimum ILIM settings to enable SMB1398 working in DIV2 mode.
	      The switcher is disabled when ILIM is below this value.
	      If this values is not specified, the default minimum ILIM is 1A.
	      This is only applicable when SMB1396 working as a DIV2 CP master.

- qcom,max-cutoff-soc
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: SOC beyond which SMB1398 is kept disabled.
	      If this value is not specified then default value is 85%.
	      This is only applicable when SMB1396 working as a DIV2 CP master.

- qcom,ilim-ua-disable-slave
  Usage:      optional
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: The minimum ILIM setting to disable slave CP after hitting taper.
	      If this value is not specified, the default value is 3 times of
	      "qcom,div2-cp-min-ilim-ua". This is only applicable when both
	      SMB1396 DIV2 CP master and slave are present.
