		flash. This is only applicable to certain PMICs like PMI632
		which has SCHGM_FLASH peripheral.

  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Specifies flash hardware headroom management policy. The
		possible values are:
		<0>: Fixed mode, constant 5V at flash input.

		dynamically controlled by the flash module based on the
		required flash headroom.
		This is only applicable to certain PMICs like PMI632 which
		has SCHGM_FLASH peripheral.
