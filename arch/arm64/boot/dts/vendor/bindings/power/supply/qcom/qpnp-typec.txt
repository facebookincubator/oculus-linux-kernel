QPNP USB Type-C module

QPNP USB Type-C module supports USB type-c ports and detection of
USB Type-C chargers that can supply upto 3A Vbus current for charging.

The QPNP USB Type-C interfaces via the SPMI bus.

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be "qcom,qpnp-typec"
- reg:			The SPMI address for this peripheral
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the peripheral.
- interrupt-names:	Specifies the interrupt names for the peripheral. Every
			available interrupt needs to have an associated name
			with it to indentify its purpose.

			- vrd-change:		Triggers on change in current
						capability of charger.
			- ufp-detach:		Triggers on cable detach in
						UFP mode.
			- ufp-detect:		Triggers on charger insertion.
			- dfp-detach:		Triggers on cable detach in
						DFP mode.
			- dfp-detect:		Triggers on OTG cable insertion.
			- vbus-err:		Triggers if VBUS is not
						detected within 275 msec after
						CC detection in UFP mode.
			- vconn-oc:		Triggers on VCONN overcurrent
						in DFP mode with active cable.

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names : This should be defined if a target uses pinctrl framework
  for SSMUX control pin. See "pinctrl" in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt.
  It should specify the names of the configs that pinctrl can install in driver.
  Following are the pinctrl config that can be installed:
      "typec_ssmux_config" : Default configuration of pins.
- <supply-name>-supply: handle to the regulator device tree node.
        "supply-name" is "ss-mux" regulator to drive super-speed MUX chip.
- qcom,role-reversal-supported : A boolean property that when present enables
			support of dual role class.

Example:
	qcom,qpnp-typec@bf00 {
		compatible = "qcom,qpnp-typec";
		reg = <0xbf00 0x100>;
		interrupts =	<0x0 0xbf 0x0>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x1>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x2>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x3>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x4>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x6>,
				<0x0 0xbf 0x7>;

		interrupt-names =	"vrd-change",
					"ufp-detach",
					"ufp-detect",
					"dfp-detach",
					"dfp-detect",
					"vbus-err",
					"vconn-oc";
	};
