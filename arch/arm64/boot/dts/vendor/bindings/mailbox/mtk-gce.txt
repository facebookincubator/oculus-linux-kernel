MediaTek GCE
===============

The Global Command Engine (GCE) is used to help read/write registers with
critical time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
vblank. The GCE can be used to implement the Command Queue (CMDQ) driver.

CMDQ driver uses mailbox framework for communication. Please refer to
mailbox.txt for generic information about mailbox device-tree bindings.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "mediatek,mt8173-gce"
- reg: Address range of the GCE unit
- interrupts: The interrupt signal from the GCE block
- clock: Clocks according to the common clock binding
- clock-names: Must be "gce" to stand for GCE clock
- #mbox-cells: Should be 3.
	<&phandle channel priority atomic_exec>
	phandle: Label name of a gce node.
	channel: Channel of mailbox. Be equal to the thread id of GCE.
	priority: Priority of GCE thread.
	atomic_exec: GCE processing continuous packets of commands in atomic
		way.

Required properties for a client device:
- mboxes: Client use mailbox to communicate with GCE, it should have this
  property and list of phandle, mailbox specifiers.
- mediatek,gce-subsys: u32, specify the sub-system id which is corresponding
  to the register address.

Some vaules of properties are defined in 'dt-bindings/gce/mt8173-gce.h'. Such as
sub-system ids, thread priority, event ids.

Example:

	gce: gce@10212000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-gce";
		reg = <0 0x10212000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 135 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&infracfg CLK_INFRA_GCE>;
		clock-names = "gce";
		thread-num = CMDQ_THR_MAX_COUNT;
		#mbox-cells = <3>;
	};

Example for a client device:

	mmsys: clock-controller@14000000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8173-mmsys";
		mboxes = <&gce 0 CMDQ_THR_PRIO_LOWEST 1>,
			 <&gce 1 CMDQ_THR_PRIO_LOWEST 1>;
		mediatek,gce-subsys = <SUBSYS_1400XXXX>;
		mutex-event-eof = <CMDQ_EVENT_MUTEX0_STREAM_EOF
				CMDQ_EVENT_MUTEX1_STREAM_EOF>;

		...
	};
