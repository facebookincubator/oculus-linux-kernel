Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Glink SPMI Debug Controller

The Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Glink SPMI debug controller device provides an
interface to read and write PMIC registers over PMIC Glink using a remote
subsytem (e.g. DSP).  This allows for debugging PMIC peripherals that would
typically only be accessible to the charger and fuel gauging firmware running
on the remote subsystem.

Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,pmic-glink.txt for
information on "qcom,pmic_glink_log" device which is used in the example below.

See spmi.txt for the generic SPMI controller binding requirements for grandchild
nodes.

Required device node structure:

The Glink SPMI debug controller node must contain at least one child node.  Each
child node corresponds to an SPMI bus accessible from the remote subsystem.

Top Level Node Supported Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Must be "qcom,spmi-glink-debug".

Child Node Supported Properties:

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Bus ID of this SPMI bus.

Example:

&soc {
	qcom,pmic_glink_log {
		qcom,spmi_glink_debug {
			compatible = "qcom,spmi-glink-debug";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			spmi@0 {
				reg = <0>;
			};

			spmi@1 {
				reg = <1>;
			};
		};
	};
};
