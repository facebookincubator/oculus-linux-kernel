Intersil ISL1219 I2C RTC/Alarm chip with event in

ISL1219 has additional pins EVIN and #EVDET for tamper detection.

Required properties supported by the device:

 - "compatible": must be "isil,isl1219"
 - "reg": I2C bus address of the device

Optional properties:

 - "interrupt-names": list which may contains "irq" and "evdet"
 - "interrupts": list of interrupts for "irq" and "evdet"
 - "isil,ev-evienb": if present EV.EVIENB bit is set to the specified
                     value for proper operation.


Example isl1219 node with #IRQ pin connected to SoC gpio1 pin12
 and #EVDET pin connected to SoC gpio2 pin 24:

	isl1219: rtc@68 {
		compatible = "isil,isl1219";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupt-names = "irq", "evdet";
		interrupts-extended = <&gpio1 12 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>,
			<&gpio2 24 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
		isil,ev-evienb = <1>;
	};
