* Slate Subsystem Peripheral Image Loader

subsys-pil-slate is a slate peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is
used for loading the firmware images of the slate subsystems into memory
and preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code. It's also
responsible for shutting down the processor when it's not needed.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,pil-slate"
- qcom,firmware-name: Base name of the firmware image.

Optional properties:
- qcom,slate2ap-status-gpio: GPIO used by the slate to indicate status to
			     the apps.
- qcom,ap2slate-status-gpio: GPIO used by the apps to indicate its status
			     to slate.


Example:
	qcom,slate {
		    compatible = "qcom,pil-slate";
		    qcom,firmware-name = "slate-wear";
		    /* GPIO inputs from blackghost */
		    qcom,slate2ap-status-gpio = <&msm_gpio 97 0>;
                    /* GPIO output to blackghost */
                    qcom,ap2slate-status-gpio = <&msm_gpio 17 0>;
	};
