Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC PON Log

Certain Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMIC devices capture power-on, power-off,
and fault information in a binary log found within SDAM peripherals.  The PMIC
PON Log device accesses this log and parses it into a human readable format.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,pmic-pon-log"

- nvmem:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle-list>
	Definition: phandle list of the PMIC nvmem devices containing the PON
		    log.

- nvmem-names:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "pon_log" if using a single nvmem device or
		    "pon_log0", "pon_log1", etc if using multiple nvmem devices.

- qcom,pmic-fault-panic:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: Boolean flag indicating that the device should trigger a
		    controlled panic shutdown if the preceding restart was
		    caused by a PMIC fault.

Examples:

pmic-pon-log {
	compatible = "qcom,pmic-pon-log";
	nvmem = <&pmk8350_sdam_5>;
	nvmem-names = "pon_log";
};

pmic-pon-log {
	compatible = "qcom,pmic-pon-log";
	nvmem = <&pmk8550_sdam_5>, <&pmk8550_sdam_6>;
	nvmem-names = "pon_log0", "pon_log1";
};
