Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CDSP Request Manager driver

CDSP Request Manager driver implements an rpmsg interface with
CDSP subsystem to serve L3 frequency and CPU QoS requests from CDSP.
It also interacts with NPU, Camera modules for Cx iPeak mitigations and
thermal module via CDSP/HVX cooling devices for thermal mitigation of
CDSP core. It sends VTCM partitioning information on supported chipsets
to CDSP.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-cdsprm-rpmsg"
- qcom,glink-channels: Glink channel for communication with CDSP
- qcom,intents: A list of <number of intents, size of each intent>

- qcom,msm-cdsp-rm: A sub-device node to define CDSPM RM, Cx iPeak mitigation
		driver, CDSP core thermal cooling device and CDSP VTCM partitioning

	Required properties:
	- compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-cdsp-rm"
	- qcom,qos-latency-us: pm_qos latency vote to be applied on CDSP request in
				micro seconds
	- qcom,qos-maxhold-ms: Maximum hold time for pm_qos latency vote from CDSP
				in milli seconds

	Optional properties:

	Cx iPeak limit management:
	- qcom,compute-cx-limit-en: To enable CX ipeak limit management for compute
				subsystem
	- qcom,compute-priority-mode: when Cx iPeak mitigation is enabled,
				this field sets desired compute priority mode
				for AIX and HVX concurrency cases based on
				following values, where in HVX and NPU cores,
				if required, are throttled in concurrency based
				on the selected priority mode
				1 : HVX_MAX - Allows HVX to run at maximum possible
						frequency during concurrency with NPU
				2 : AIX_MAX - Allows NPU to run at maximum possible
						frequency during concurrency with HVX
				3 : HVX_OVER_AIX - Allows HVX to run at a higher
						frequency than NPU during concurrency
				4 : AIX_OVER_HVX - Allows NPU to run at a higher
						frequency than HVX during concurrency

	VTCM partitioning:
	- qcom,vtcm-paritions: Number of VTCM partitions (maximum 16)
	- qcom,vtcm-partition-info: Specifies the partitions, their sizes and
				flags. Most importantly flags can be used to
				set some partitions as privileged,
				i.e. only available to privileged clients.
				Currently VTCM_FLAG_PRIMARY(0x1), VTCM_FLAG_SECONDARY (0x2)and
				VTCM_FLAG_PRIVILEGED(0x4) are the supported flags per partition
				(only one per partition).
				Size of each partition should be a multiple of 256KB.
				Given 256KB is the minimum VTCM allocation size,
				256K, 1M, 4M are supported page sizes.
				Specifying a 3MB partition will allow maximum of 1MB page (3x).
				Similarly, a 512KB partition will be of 256KB pages (2x).
				PRIMARY and SECONDARY partitions are available to all the clients while
				the PRIMARY partition is used by default. Partition selection is
				controlled by the vtcm-partition-map information.
				There must be only one PRIMARY partition.
				Partitions must be defined with a linear partition index
				starting with 0 till (Number of VTCM partitions - 1).
				VTCM memory will be partitioned in the order provided
				(0 being the first partition).
	- qcom,vtcm-partition-map: Maps application type identifiers to
				partitions. Clients use application type IDs to
				request non-default partitions.
				Application identifier is specified as a value [0 – 31]
				in the device tree. The default application identifier
				will be 0. Application identifier must be unique for each
				partition map. Any unassigned application identifier
				in the set of [0 – 31] will be mapped to the PRIMARY partition
				and will return failure if there is no
				PRIMARY partition configured.

	Thermal cooling device:
	- #cooling-cells: Number of cooling cells for CDSP cooling device based on
			CDSP Q6 core clock throttling
