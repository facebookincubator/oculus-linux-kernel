* Qualcomm Technologies Inc Embedded USB Debugger (EUD)

The EUD (Embedded USB Debugger) is a mini-USB hub implemented
on chip to support the USB-based debug and trace capabilities.

Required properties:

 - compatible:  Should be "qcom,msm-eud"
 - interrupt-names:  Should be "eud_irq"
 - interrupts:  Interrupt number
 - reg: Should be address and size of EUD register space
 - reg-names: Should be "eud_base"

Optional properties:
 - reg-names: 	Can be "eud_mode_mgr2" for secure eud.
		"eud_tcsr_check_reg" needs to be defined, in
		case the "eud_mode_mgr2" is protected by this
		register.
 - qcom,secure-eud-en: To enable secure eud
 - qcom,eud-clock-vote-req: To enable clock voting from eud
 - qcom,eud-tcsr-check-enable: Boolean- Present if we need to set
		"eud_tcsr_check_reg" register before setting
		the "eud_mode_mgr2" register.

Driver notifies clients via extcon for VBUS spoof attach/detach
and charger enable/disable events. Clients registered for these
notifications should have extcon property set to eud.

An example for EUD device node:

	eud: qcom,msm-eud@88e0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-eud";
		interrupt-names = "eud_irq";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 492 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		reg = <0x88e0000 0x4000>;
		reg-names = "eud_base";
	};

An example for EUD extcon client:

	usb3 {
		extcon = <&eud>;
	};
