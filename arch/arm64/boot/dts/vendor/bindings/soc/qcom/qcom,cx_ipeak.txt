* Cx iPeak driver to handle requests from various multimedia clients.

Cx ipeak HW module is used to limit the current drawn by various subsystem
blocks on Cx power rail. Each client needs to set their bit in tcsr register
if it is going to cross its own threshold. If all clients are going to cross
their thresholds then Cx ipeak hw module will raise an interrupt to cDSP block
to throttle cDSP's fmax.
There are SOC like SCUBA in which Cx ipeak HW module raise interrupt to throttle
frequency of other victim clients.

Required properties:

- compatible : name of the component used for driver matching, should be one
	       "qcom,cx-ipeak-v1", "qcom,cx-ipeak-v2"

- reg : physical base address and length of the register set(s), SRAM and XPU
	of the component.

Optional properties:
- interrupts : Danger and Safe interrupts details having interrupt number and
	type of interrupt.

- interrupt-names : Identifier names for Danger and Safe interrupts.

- victims_table : Victim clients details having client ID, victim ID and limit
	frequency to be applied in case of danger interrupt.

Example:

	cx_ipeak_lm: cx_ipeak@1fe5040 {
		compatible = "qcom,cx-ipeak-v1";
		reg = <0x01fe5040 0x28>;
	interrupts = <0 415 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>,
		     <0 416 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		interrupt-names = "cx_ipeak_danger", "cx_ipeak_safe";
		victims_table = <1 0 844800000>;
	};
