* Cx iPeak driver to handle requests from various multimedia clients.

Cx ipeak HW module is used to limit the current drawn by various subsystem
blocks on Cx power rail. Each client needs to set their bit in tcsr register
if it is going to cross its own threshold. If all clients are going to cross
their thresholds then Cx ipeak hw module will raise an interrupt to cDSP block
to throttle cDSP's fmax.

Required properties:

- compatible : name of the component used for driver matching, should be one
	       "qcom,cx-ipeak-v1", "qcom,cx-ipeak-v2"

- reg : physical base address and length of the register set(s), SRAM and XPU
	of the component.

Example:

	cx_ipeak_lm: cx_ipeak@1fe5040 {
		compatible = "qcom,cx-ipeak-v1";
		reg = <0x01fe5040 0x28>;
	};
