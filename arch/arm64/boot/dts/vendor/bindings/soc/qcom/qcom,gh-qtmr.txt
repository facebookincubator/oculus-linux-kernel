QCT Gunyah Hypervisor irq Lending Test Driver

The Gunyah Hypervisor Test Driver is used to validate gunyah hypervisor
functionality. It includes test node for gunyah irq lending between vms.
Qtime timer and irq will be lended between vms.

Required properties:
- compatible:	"qcom,gh-qtmr"
- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		Names of the bases for the above registers. Expected
			bases are: "qtmr-base"
- interrupts:		Lists the threshold IRQ.
- interrupt-names:  Names of the interrupts.
- qcom,primary or qcom,secondary: primary is for PVM / secondary is for SVM

Example:

	qcom,gh-qtimer@17425000{
		compatible = "qcom,gh-qtmr";
		reg = <0x17425000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "qtmr-base";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 10 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "qcom,qtmr-intr";
		qcom,primary;
	};
