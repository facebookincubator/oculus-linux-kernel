QTI PMU Driver

This driver provides an interface to request for per-CPU performance counters
that are available on some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipsets.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,pmu"
- qcom,long-counter	Specify if the pmu counters are long (64 bit) counters.
- qcom,pmu-events-tbl:	A list of the pmu events to be configured on the cpus.
			The first column in the table contains the event id and
			the second column contains a bit mask (cpumask) of
			cpus for which the event should be configured on.
			The third column contains the AMU id for events that are
			present as part of AMU counters. The list of ids can be
			found in enum amu_counters (include/soc/qcom/pmu_lib.h).
			0xFF represents an invalid id.
			The fourth column represents the index in enum
			cpucp_ev_idx (include/linux/scmi_pmu.h), which is a
			shared enum between hlos and cpucp. This helps
			maintain the sequence of events when pmu hardware ids
			or cached counts are shared between hlos and cpucp.
			0xFF represents an invalid index, which means this event
			is not supposed to be shared between hlos and cpucp.

Example:

	qcom,pmu {
		compatible = "qcom,pmu";
		qcom,long-counter;
		qcom,pmu-events-tbl =
			< 0x0008 0xFF 0x02 0x02 >,
			< 0x0011 0xFF 0x01 0x01 >,
			< 0x0017 0xFF 0xFF 0x04 >,
			< 0x002A 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF >,
			< 0x1000 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF >;
	};
