* QTI Type-C Alternate Mode over GLINK bindings

The Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Type-C Alternate (alt) Mode GLINK device
provides an interface for Type-C alternate mode clients to receive data such as
Pin Assignment Notifications from the Type-C stack running on a remote
subsystem (e.g. DSP) via the PMIC GLINK interface.

Please refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/soc/qcom/qcom,pmic-glink.txt
for information on the "qcom,pmic_glink" device used in the example below.

REQUIRED PROPERTIES:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: must be "qcom,altmode-glink"

- #altmode-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be <1>

EXAMPLE of altmode node definition:

&soc {
	qcom,pmic_glink {
		...
		altmode: qcom,altmode {
			compatible = "qcom,altmode-glink";
			#altmode-cells = <1>;
		};
		...
	};
};

Altmode client bindings:

REQUIRED PROPERTIES:

- qcom,altmode-dev:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: must be <phandle_to_altmode_node, N> where N is port index

EXAMPLE of altmode client node definition:

altmode-client {
	...
	qcom,altmode-dev = <&altmode 0>;
	...
}
