QTI DCVS Fast Path Interface

The QTI DCVS Fast Path Interface utilizes the fast-path TCS hardware interface
provided by RPMH RSC. As such, this driver is a child node and client of an
RPMH RSC device that has a fast path TCS. The driver is intended to be used by
the QTI DCVS framework for DCVS_FAST_PATH voting on DDR and LLCC HW.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,dcvs-fp"
- qcom,ddr-bcm-name:	DDR BCM name
- qcom,llcc-bcm-name:	LLCC BCM name

Example:

	apps_rsc: rsc@18200000 {
		compatible = "qcom,rpmh-rsc";

		dcvs_fp: qcom,dcvs-fp {
			compatible = "qcom,dcvs-fp";
			qcom,ddr-bcm-name = "MC3";
			qcom,llcc-bcm-name = "SH8";
		};
	};
