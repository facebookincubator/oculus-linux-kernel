* Helios Coprocessor Communication Driver

helioscom_spi driver provides a set of apis to perform
register, fifo, ahb read and write operations with helios
over spi interface. It also reads helios status and
sends events to the registered clients.

Required properties:
- compatible:	      Must be "qcom,helios-spi"

Optional properties:
- qcom,irq-gpio: IRQ used by the helios to inturrupt MSM.

Example:
	qcom,helios-spi {
		compatible = "qcom,helios-spi";
			compatible = "qcom,helios-spi";
			interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
			/* IRQ from helios */
			qcom,irq-gpio = <&tlmm 41 1>;
		};
