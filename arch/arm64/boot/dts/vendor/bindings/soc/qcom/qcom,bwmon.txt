QTI BWMON Driver

The QTI BWMON Driver monitors bandwidth counters that represent the read/write
traffic through various interconnects in the system and uses this data to vote
for DCVS HW (memory) frequencies. Each device represents a separate bandwidth
monitor present on the Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipset. This driver
is a refactor of the bimc-bwmon driver that was previously developed.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,bwmon", "qcom,bwmon2", "qcom,bwmon3"
			"qcom,bwmon4", or "qcom,bwmon5"
- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		Names of the bases for the above registers. Expected
			bases are: "base", "global_base"
- interrupts:		Lists the threshold IRQ.
- qcom,mport:		The hardware master port that this device can monitor
- qcom,target-dev:	A phandle to the QTI DCVS HW device node that this
			node will be using for voting in the SLOW path.
- qcom,hw-timer-hz:	Hardware sampling rate in Hz. This field must be
			specified for "qcom,bwmon4"
Optional properties:
- qcom,byte-mid-match:	Byte count MID match value
- qcom,byte-mid-mask:	Byte count MID mask value
- qcom,count-unit:	Number of bytes monitor counts in

Example:

	bwmon_llcc: qcom,bwmon-llcc@90b6400 {
		compatible = "qcom,bwmon4";
		reg = <0x90b6400 0x300>, <0x90b6300 0x200>;
		reg-names = "base", "global_base";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 581 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		qcom,mport = <0>;
		qcom,hw-timer-hz = <19200000>;
		qcom,count-unit = <0x10000>;
		qcom,target-dev = <&qcom_llcc_dcvs_hw>;
	};
