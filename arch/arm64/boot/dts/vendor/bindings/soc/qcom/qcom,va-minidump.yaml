title: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. VA Minidump driver

description: |
  VA based minidump driver helps in registering dynamic data structures
  from vendor modules with minidump. This driver works on VA, which
  would be contiguous even if physical pages are scattered. Each client
  can register area with contiguous VA as a section for ELF. This driver
  creates ELF in panic notifier, combining all the section registered
  by client drivers.
