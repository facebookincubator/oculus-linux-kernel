QTI BWPROF Driver

The QTI BWPROF Driver is responsible for monitoring bandwidth counters on
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) chipset that represent the read/write traffic
through different interconnects in the system. The driver provides this data to
userspace clients at modest time intervals for the purpose of bandwidth
profiling.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,bwprof" or "qcom,bwprof-mon"
- reg:			Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
			memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:		Names of the bases for the above registers. Expected
			bases are: "base", "llcc-reg", "mem-freq"
- qcom,bus-width:	The width of the bus in bits.
- client:		The client of bandwidth monitor, which can be either
			"total", "cpu", or "gpu".

Example:

    bwprof: qcom,bwprof-ddr@19090000 {
            compatible = "qcom,bwprof";
            #address-cells = <1>;
            #size-cells = <1>;
            qcom,bus-width = <16>;
            ranges;
            reg = <0x190BA050 0x10>;
            reg-names = "mem-freq";

            bwprof_0: qcom,bwprof0@19092000 {
                    compatible = "qcom,bwprof-mon";
                    reg = <0x19092000 0x1000>, <0x1A663000 0x1000>;
                    reg-names = "base", "llcc-reg";
                    client = "total";
            };

            bwprof_1: qcom,bwprof1@19093000 {
                    compatible = "qcom,bwprof-mon";
                    reg = <0x19093000 0x1000>, <0x1A664000 0x1000>;
                    reg-names = "base", "llcc-reg";
                    client = "cpu";
            };

            bwprof_2: qcom,bwprof2@19094000 {
                    compatible = "qcom,bwprof-mon";
                    reg = <0x19094000 0x1000>, <0x1A665000 0x1000>;
                    reg-names = "base", "llcc-reg";
                    client = "gpu";
            };

    };
