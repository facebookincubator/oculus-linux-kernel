* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GSI driver module

GSI is a HW accelerator that supports Generic SW Interfaces (GSI) which are
peripheral specific (IPA in this case).
GSI translates SW transfer elements (TRE) into TLV transactions which are
then processed by the peripheral.
This Driver configures and communicates with GSI HW.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,msm_gsi"

Example:
