* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. IPA MHI proxy driver module

This module enables modem to modem communication using IPA
and MHI.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,ipa-mhi-proxy"
- qcom,mhi-chdb-base:	MHI channel doorbell base address in MMIO space
- qcom,mhi-erdb-base:	MHI event doorbell base address in MMIO space

Optional:
- qcom,ctrl-iova: 		Pair of start address and size of the IOVA space
				dedicated for MHI control structures
				(such as transfer rings and event rings).
				If not present, SMMU S1 is considered to be in bypass mode.
- qcom,data-iova: 		Pair of start address and size of the IOVA space
				dedicated for MHI data buffers.
				If not present, SMMU S1 is considered to be in bypass mode.

Example:
	imp: qcom,ipa-mhi-proxy {
		compatible = "qcom,ipa-mhi-proxy";
		qcom,ctrl-iova = <0x00010000 0x0FFF0000>;
		qcom,data-iova = <0x10000000 0x0FFFFFFF>;
		qcom,mhi-chdb-base = <0x40300300>;
		qcom,mhi-erdb-base = <0x40300700>;
	};
