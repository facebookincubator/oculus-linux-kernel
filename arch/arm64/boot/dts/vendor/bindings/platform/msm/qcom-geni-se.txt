Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. GENI Serial Engine Driver

GENI Serial Engine Driver is used to configure and read the configuration
from the Serial Engines on Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Universal Peripheral
(QUPv3) core. It is also used to enable the stage1 IOMMU translation and
manage resources associated with the QUPv3 core.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,qupv3-geni-se".
- reg:			Must contain QUPv3 register address and length.
- qcom,bus-mas-id:	Master Endpoint ID for bus driver.
- qcom,bus-slv-id:	Slave Endpoint ID for bus driver.

Optional properties:
- qcom,iommu-s1-bypass:	Boolean flag to bypass IOMMU stage 1 translation.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths: Number of paths to put vote for.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-bus-ids: Master and slave Endpoint IDs for DDR
				and Corex/2x paths.
- interconnect-names:	"qup-core" for the qup master to slave path
			"snoc-llcc" middle path from SNOC to GEMNOC
			"qup-ddr" for the qup master to DDR path
			This way ensure the path from aggre1_noc ->
			system_noc -> gem_noc -> mc_virt is complete.
- interconnects:	Master to Slave endpoint nodes for the required paths.

Optional subnodes:
qcom,iommu_qupv3_geni_se_cb:	Child node representing the QUPV3 context
				bank.

Subnode Required properties:
- compatible :		Must be "qcom,qupv3-geni-se-cb";
- iommus:		A list of phandle and IOMMU specifier pairs that
			describe the IOMMU master interfaces of the device.

Example:
	qupv3_0: qcom,qupv3_0_geni_se@8c0000 {
		compatible = "qcom,qupv3-geni-se";
		reg = <0x8c0000 0x6000>;
		qcom,bus-mas-id = <100>;
		qcom,bus-slv-id = <300>;

		iommu_qupv3_0_geni_se_cb: qcom,iommu_qupv3_0_geni_se_cb {
			compatible = "qcom,qupv3-geni-se-cb";
			iommus = <&apps_smmu 0x1 0x0>;
		};
	}
