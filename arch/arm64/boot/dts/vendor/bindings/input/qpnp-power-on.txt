Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QPNP Power-on PMIC Peripheral Device Tree Bindings

qpnp-power-on devices support the power-on (PON) peripheral found on
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. PMICs. The supported functionality includes power
on/off reason, key press/release detection, PMIC reset configurations and other
PON specific features. The PON module supports multiple physical power-on
(KPDPWR_N, CBLPWR) and reset (KPDPWR_N, RESIN, KPDPWR+RESIN) sources. This
peripheral is connected to the host processor via the SPMI interface.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,qpnp-power-on"
- reg:				Specifies the SPMI base address for this PON
				(power-on) peripheral.

Optional properties:
- interrupts:			Specifies the interrupts associated with PON.
- interrupt-names:		Specifies the interrupt names associated with
				the interrupts property. Must be a subset of
				"kpdpwr", "kpdpwr-bark", "resin", "resin-bark",
				"cblpwr", "kpdpwr-resin-bark", and
				"pmic-wd-bark". Bark interrupts are associated
				with system reset configuration to allow default
				reset configuration to be activated. If system
				reset configuration is not supported then bark
				interrupts are nops. Additionally, the
				"pmic-wd-bark" interrupt can be added if the
				system needs to handle PMIC watchdog barks.
- qcom,pon-dbc-delay:		The debounce delay for the power-key interrupt
				specified in us.
				Possible values for GEN1 PON are:
				15625, 31250, 62500, 125000, 250000, 500000,
				1000000 and 2000000.
				Possible values for GEN2 PON are:
				62, 123, 245, 489, 977, 1954, 3907, 7813,
				15625, 31250, 62500, 125000 and 250000.
				Intermediate value is rounded down to the
				nearest valid value.
- qcom,system-reset:		Boolean which specifies that this PON peripheral
				can be used to reset the system. This property
				can only be used by one device on the system. It
				is an error to include it more than once.
- qcom,modem-reset:		Boolean which specifies that this PON peripheral
				can be used to reset the attached modem chip.
				This property can only be used by one PON device
				on the system. qcom,modem-reset and
				qcom,system-reset cannot be specified for the
				same PON device.
- qcom,s3-debounce:		The debounce delay for stage 3 reset trigger in
				secs. The values range from 0 to 128.
- qcom,s3-src:			The source for stage 3 reset. It can be one of
				"kpdpwr", "resin", "kpdpwr-or-resin" or
				"kpdpwr-and-resin".
- qcom,uvlo-panic:		Boolean indicating that the device should
				trigger a controlled panic shutdown if a restart
				was caused by under voltage lock-out (UVLO).
- qcom,clear-warm-reset:	Boolean which specifies that the WARM_RESET
				reason registers need to be cleared for this
				target. The property is used for the targets
				which have a hardware feature to catch resets
				which aren't triggered by the application
				processor. In such cases clearing WARM_REASON
				registers across processor resets keeps the
				registers in a useful state.
- qcom,secondary-pon-reset:	Boolean property which indicates that the PON
				peripheral is a secondary PON device which
				needs to be configured during reset in addition
				to the primary PON device that is configured
				for system reset through qcom,system-reset
				property.
				This should not be defined along with the
				qcom,system-reset or qcom,modem-reset property.
- qcom,store-hard-reset-reason:	Boolean property which if set will store the
				hardware reset reason to SOFT_RB_SPARE register
				of the core PMIC PON peripheral.
- qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-type:	Poweroff type required to be configured
				on PS_HOLD reset control register when the
				system goes for warm reset. If this property is
				not specified, then the default type, warm reset
				will be configured to PS_HOLD reset control
				register.
				Supported values: PON_POWER_OFF_TYPE_* found in
				include/dt-bindings/input/qcom,qpnp-power-on.h
- qcom,hard-reset-poweroff-type:	Same description as
				qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-type but this applies
				for the system hard reset case.
- qcom,shutdown-poweroff-type:	Same description as qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-
				type but this applies for the system shutdown
				case.
- qcom,kpdpwr-sw-debounce:	Boolean property to enable the debounce logic
				on the KPDPWR_N rising edge.
- qcom,resin-pon-reset:		Boolean property which indicates that resin
				needs to be configured during reset in addition
				to the primary PON device that is configured
				for system reset through qcom,system-reset
				property.
- qcom,resin-warm-reset-type: 	Poweroff type required to be configured on
				RESIN reset control register when the system
				initiates warm reset. If this property is not
				specified, then the default type, warm reset
				will be configured to RESIN reset control
				register. This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
				Supported values: PON_POWER_OFF_TYPE_* found in
				include/dt-bindings/input/qcom,qpnp-power-on.h
- qcom,resin-hard-reset-type: 	Same description as qcom,resin-warm-reset-type
				but this applies for the system hard reset case.
- qcom,resin-shutdown-type:   	Same description as qcom,resin-warm-reset-type
				but this applies for the system shutdown case.
- qcom,resin-shutdown-disable:	Boolean property to disable RESIN power off
				trigger during system shutdown case.
				This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
- qcom,resin-hard-reset-disable:	Boolean property to disable RESIN power
	                        off trigger during system hard reset case.
				This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
- qcom,ps-hold-shutdown-disable:	Boolean property to disable PS_HOLD
				power off trigger during system shutdown case.
- qcom,ps-hold-hard-reset-disable:	Boolean property to disable PS_HOLD
				power off trigger during system hard reset case.
- qcom,log-kpd-event:		Boolean property to enable logging of KPDPWR status
				during driver INIT and runtime when key is pressed.
