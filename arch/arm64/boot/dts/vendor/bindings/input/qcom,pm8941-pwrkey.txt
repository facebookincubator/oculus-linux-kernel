Qualcomm PM8941 PMIC Power Key

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be one of:
		    "qcom,pm8941-pwrkey"
		    "qcom,pm8941-resin"
		    "qcom,pmk8350-pwrkey"
		    "qcom,pmk8350-resin"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Specifies the SPMI base address for the PON (power-on)
		    peripheral.  For PMICs that have PON peripheral (GEN3) split
		    into PON_HLOS and PON_PBS (e.g. PMK8350), this can hold
		    addresses of both PON_HLOS and PON_PBS peripherals.
		    In that case, the PON_PBS address needs to be specified
		    to facilitate software debouncing on some PMICs.

- reg-names:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: For PON GEN1 and GEN2, it should be "pon".  For PON GEN3, it
		    should include "pon_hlos" and optionally "pon_pbs".

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: key change interrupt; The format of the specifier is
		    defined by the binding document describing the node's
		    interrupt parent.

- debounce:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: time in microseconds that key must be pressed or released
		    for state change interrupt to trigger.  Note that this
		    property isn't meaningful for PMK8350 or other PON GEN3
		    PMICs.

- bias-pull-up:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: presence of this property indicates that the KPDPWR_N pin
		    should be configured for pull up.  Note that this property
		    isn't meaningful for PMK8350 or other PON GEN3 PMICs.

- linux,code:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The input key-code associated with the power key.
		    Use the linux event codes defined in
		    include/dt-bindings/input/linux-event-codes.h
		    When property is omitted KEY_POWER is assumed.

- qcom,log-kpd-event:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: Boolean property to enable logging of KPDPWR status
		    during driver INIT and during runtime when key is pressed.
