* ROHM BD71837 Power Management Integrated Circuit bindings

BD71837MWV is a programmable Power Management IC for powering single-core,
dual-core, and quad-core SoCs such as NXP-i.MX 8M. It is optimized for
low BOM cost and compact solution footprint. It integrates 8 Buck
egulators and 7 LDOs to provide all the power rails required by the SoC and
the commonly used peripherals.

Datasheet for PMIC is available at:
https://www.rohm.com/datasheet/BD71837MWV/bd71837mwv-e

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "rohm,bd71837".
 - reg			: I2C slave address.
 - interrupt-parent	: Phandle to the parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts		: The interrupt line the device is connected to.
 - clocks		: The parent clock connected to PMIC. If this is missing
			  32768 KHz clock is assumed.
 - #clock-cells		: Should be 0.
 - regulators:		: List of child nodes that specify the regulators.
			  Please see ../regulator/rohm,bd71837-regulator.txt

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names	: Should contain name for output clock.

Example:

	/* external oscillator node */
	osc: oscillator {
		compatible = "fixed-clock";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-frequency  = <32768>;
		clock-output-names = "osc";
	};

	pmic: pmic@4b {
		compatible = "rohm,bd71837";
		reg = <0x4b>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio1>;
		interrupts = <29 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
		interrupt-names = "irq";
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&osc 0>;
		clock-output-names = "bd71837-32k-out";

		regulators {
			buck1: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "buck1";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <700000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-boot-on;
				regulator-ramp-delay = <1250>;
			};
		};
	};

	/* Clock consumer node */
	rtc@0 {
		compatible = "company,my-rtc";
		clock-names = "my-clock";
		clocks = <&pmic>;
	};
