QTI CPU pause cooling devices.

The CPU pause cooling device will be used for isolating a CPU on a thermal
condition. This cooling device driver can register one cooling device per
signle or multiple CPUs, which can be used by thermal zone to mitigate.

Each child node will represent a cooling device and the child node should
point to the CPU mask, which will be mitigated by that cooling device instance.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,thermal-pause"

Cooling device node:
- qcom,cpus:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <list of CPU Phandles>
	Definition: List of Phandles to the CPUs that should be mitigated as
			a part of this cooling device.

-#cooling-cells:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. Needed for of_thermal as cooling device
			identifier. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details. This is not needed for devicetree based
			cooling devices.

- qcom,cdev-alias:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Alias name for the cooling device. When specified, this
			name will be used to create a cooling device instead
			of using the default name based on CPU mask.
Example:
	qcom,thermal-pause {
		compatible = "qcom,thermal-pause";

		/* pause a single cpu, cpu 0 */
		thermal_pause-01: thermal-pause-01 {
			qcom,cpus = <&CPU0>;
			qcom,cdev-alias = "pause_cpu0";
		};

		/* pause a group of cpus, cpus 0-3 */
		thermal_pause-0F: thermal-pause-0F {
			qcom,cpus = <&CPU0 &CPU1 &CPU2 &CPU3>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};

		/* pause a group of cpus, cpus 6-7 */
		thermal_pause-C0: thermal-pause-C0 {
			qcom,cpus = <&CPU4 &CPU5 &CPU6 &CPU7>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};

		/* pause a single cpu, cpu 7 */
		thermal_pause-80:  thermal-pause-80 {
			qcom,cpus = <&CPU7>;
			#cooling-cells = <2>;
		};
        };
