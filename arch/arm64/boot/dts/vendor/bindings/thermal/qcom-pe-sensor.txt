Policy Engine(PE) recommendation as sensor.

The QTI Policy Engine sensor device will register the policy engine
recommendation with thermal framework as a sensor. This will enable
to provide configuration to mitigate cooling devices when a recommendation
is sent from Policy Engine hardware. The recommendations are mitigation
levels based on CX operating level.

There can be multiple Policy Engine hardwares for different rails.

Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,policy-engine"

- reg:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <u32>
    Definition: RDPM_PE base address.

- #thermal-sensor-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 0. See thermal.txt for description.

- interrupts:
    Usage: required
    Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
    Definition: Policy Engine master interrupt.


Example:

cx_rdpm_pe@0x00635000 {
	compatible = "qcom,policy-engine";
	#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
	reg = <0x00635000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 243 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
};
