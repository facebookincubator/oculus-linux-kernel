Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. CX Peak current cooling device

The CX IPEAK cooling device, will be used to set thermal client vote to
CX IPEAK  LM hardware. When all pre-defined clients on CX rail including
thermal client set their vote, CXIP LM hardware throttles pre-defined
client on the same rail.

Required Parameters:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,cxip-lm-cooling-device"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <values in hex>
	Definition: Must contain 2 variables <a b> where 'a' is the starting
		register address of the CX IPEAK LM hardware and 'b' is the
		size of the peripheral address space.

- qcom,thermal-client-offset:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <value in hex>
	Definition: This property is required for CX IP LM v1.1 and above
		hardware. Must contain offset from CX IPEAK LM reg
		base for thermal client voting. If this property is not defined,
		then CX IPEAK cooling device will use legacy CXIP LM hardware
		offset registers.

- qcom,bypass-client-list:
	Usage: Optional
	Value type: <value in hex>
	Definition: This property is required for CX IP LM v1.1 and above
		hardware. Must contain array of offsets from CX IPEAK LM reg
		base for clients those are not participating voting to CXIP LM
		hardware. This property makes sense only when thermal-client
		is defined.

- #cooling-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <integer>
	Definition: Must be 2. This is required by of-thermal and refer the doc
		<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more details.

Example:

	cxip_cdev: cxip-cdev@1fed000 {
		compatible = "qcom,cxip-lm-cooling-device";
		reg = <0x1fed000 0x24>;
		qcom,thermal-client-offset = <0x8000>;
		qcom,bypass-client-list = <0x2004 0x3004>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
