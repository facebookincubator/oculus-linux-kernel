BCL PMIC Peripheral driver:
===============================================================================
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc's PMIC has battery current limiting peripheral, which can monitor for
high battery current and low battery voltage in the hardware. The BCL
peripheral driver interacts with the PMIC peripheral using the SPMI driver
interface. The hardware can take threshold for notifying for high battery
current or low battery voltage events.

Required Parameters:
- compatible: must be
	'qcom,msm-bcl-lmh' for bcl peripheral with LMH DCVSh interface.
- reg: <a b> where 'a' is the starting register address of the PMIC
	peripheral and 'b' is the size of the peripheral address space.
	If the BCL inhibit current derating feature is enabled, this must also
	have the PON spare registers as well. Example: <a b c d> where
	c is the first PON spare register that will be written and d is the
	size of the registers space needed to be written. Certain version
	of PMIC, can send interrupt to LMH hardware driver directly. In that
	case the shadow peripheral address space should be mentioned along
	with the bcl peripherals address.
- interrupts: <a b c> Where 'a' is the SLAVE ID of the PMIC, 'b' is
		the peripheral ID and 'c' is the interrupt number in PMIC.
- interrupt-names: user defined names for the interrupts. These
		interrupt names will be used by the drivers to identify the
		interrupts, instead of specifying the ID's. bcl driver will
		accept these five standard interrupts.
		"bcl-low-vbat"
		"bcl-very-low-vbat"
		"bcl-crit-low-vbat"
		"bcl-high-ibat"
		"bcl-very-high-ibat"
