Regulator cooling device.

The regulator cooling device, will be used to place a voltage floor
restriction on a rail.

Properties:

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: shall be "qcom,regulator-cooling-device"

- cdev-supply:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: phandle to the regulator to which the cooling device will
			place a floor mitigation.

- regulator-levels:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <U32 array>
	Definition: Array of regulator voltages the cooling device should
			use to place a floor restriction. The voltages should
			be specified in descending order.

- #cooling-cells: Must be 2. Please refer to
			<devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt> for more
			details.

Example:

	mv_cdev: mx-cdev-lvl {
		compatible = "qcom,regulator-cooling-device";
		cdev-supply = <&regulator-cdev-supply>;
		regulator-levels = <RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_NOM
			RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_OFF>;
		#cooling-cells = <2>;
	};
