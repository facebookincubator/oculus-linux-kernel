QTI CPU frequency cooling devices.

The CPU frequency cooling device will be used by userspace thermal daemon to
vote for frequency cap under thermal conditions. This driver will register a
cooling device for each CPU phandle specified in the devicetree.

Properties:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,cpufreq-cdev"

Cooling device node:
- qcom,cpus:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <list of CPU Phandles>
	Definition: List of Phandles to the CPUs. Each CPU will be registered
			as a separate cooling device with thermal framework.

Example:
	qcom,cpufreq-cdev {
		compatible = "qcom,cpufreq-cdev";
		qcom,cpus = <&CPU0 &CPU4 &CPU7>;
        };
