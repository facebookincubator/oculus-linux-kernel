* Low Power Management Levels

The application processor can do a variety of cluster level low power modes.
It does so by predicting the low power mode based on latency and residency
information of various CPUs and clusters.

To make cluster low power mode decision, cluster device use the different prediction
algorithms so that chosen the particular low power mode more efficiently.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,lpm-cluster-dev"

- power-domains:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: must be parent domain phandle

[Example dts]
	cluster-device {
		compatible =  "qcom,lpm-cluster-dev";
		power-domains = <&CLUSTER_PD>;
	};
