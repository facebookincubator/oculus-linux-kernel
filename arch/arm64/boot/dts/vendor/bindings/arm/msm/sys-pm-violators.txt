SYSTEM PM VIOLATORS

System PM Violoators is a virtual device sends a QMP message to AOP to start
recording subsystems that are preventing system low power modes - AOSS sleep,
CX PC, DDR low power from happening during a test duration. The stats are
saved in MSGRAM and are read and displayed from Linux in debugfs.

PROPERTIES

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must have "qcom,sys-pm-violators". Additionally, one of the
		    below SoC specific compatible must be specified.
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-lahaina"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-waipio"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-diwali"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-cape"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-parrot"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-neo"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-anorak"
		    - "qcom,sys-pm-ravelin"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: The address on the AOP Message RAM from where the stats
		    are read.

- mbox:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: handle to the QMP mailbox.
		    The second argument, channel is always '0'.

EXAMPLE

	sys-pm-vx@c320000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sys-pm-violators", "qcom,sys-pm-lahaina";
		reg = <0xc320000 0x0400>;
		mboxes = <&qmp_aop 0>;
		mbox-names = "aop";
	};
