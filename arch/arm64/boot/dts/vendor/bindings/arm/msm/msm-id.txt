* MSM-ID

The qcom,msm-id entry specifies the MSM chipset, platform, hardware revision
and optional manufactured foundry.  It can optionally be an array of these to
indicate multiple hardware that use the same device tree.  It is expected that
the bootloader will use this information at boot-up to decide which device tree
to use when given multiple device trees, some of which may not be compatible
with the actual hardware.  It is the bootloader's responsibility to pass the
correct device tree to the kernel.

Format:

It is expected that the qcom,msm-id entry be at the top level of the device
tree structure.  The format can take one of the two forms below:

   qcom,msm-id = <chipset_foundry_id, platform_id, rev_id> [, <c2, p2, r2> ...]
   qcom,msm-id = <chipset_foundry_id, rev_id> [, <c2, r2> ...]

If the second format is used one must also define the board-id.

The "chipset_foundry_id" consists of three fields as below:

   bits 0-15  = The unique MSM chipset id.
   bits 16-23 = The optional foundry id. If bootloader doesn't find a device
		tree which has exact matching foundry-id with hardware it
		chooses the device tree with foundry-id = 0.
   bits 24-31 = Reserved.

Example:
   qcom,msm-id = <0x1007e 15 0>;

   qcom,board-id= <15 2>;
   qcom,msm-id = <0x1007e 0>;
