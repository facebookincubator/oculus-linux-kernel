* Qualcomm Technologies Inc MSM VIDC VMEM

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm-vmem"
- interrupts : Contains the interrupt that maps to the VMEM module
- reg : A set of 2 start address and size pairs that describe the hardware
register address space and mappable memory address space.
- reg-names : Strings that describe the pairs in "reg".  The register address
space should be called "reg-base" and the memory space should be called "mem-base".
- clocks : A set of clocks that correspond to the AHB and MAXI clocks that the
hardware uses.
- clock-names : A string that describes the "clocks" property.  The AHB clock
should be named "ahb" and the MAXI clock should be named "maxi".
- qcom,bank-size : The size of each memory bank, in bytes.
- vdd-supply: phandle to a regulator that is considered to be the footswitch for vmem.
- qcom,msm-bus,(name|num-cases,num-paths,vectors-KBps) - Bus to be voted for prior to
  issuing any IO transactions to vmem.  Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/\
  msm/msm_bus_adhoc.txt for further details.

Example:

	clocks = <&clock_mmss clk_vmem_ahb_clk>,
	       <&clock_mmss clk_vmem_maxi_clk>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "maxi";

	qcom,bank-size = <131072>;

	qcom,msm-bus,name = "vmem";
