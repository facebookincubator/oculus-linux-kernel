* TZLOG (Trust Zone Log)

The tz_log driver is a platform device driver that exposes a debugfs
interface for accessing and displaying diagnostic information
related to secure code (Trustzone/QSEE).

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "qcom,tz-log"
- reg        : Offset and size of the register set for the device

Optional properties:
- qcom,hyplog-enabled   : (boolean) indicates if driver supports HYP logger service.
- hyplog-address-offset : Register offset to get the HYP log base address.
- hyplog-size-offset    : Register offset to get the HYP log size parameter.

	qcom,tz-log@146bf720 {
		compatible = "qcom,tz-log";
                reg = <0x146bf720, 0x3000>;
		qcom,hyplog-enabled;
		hyplog-address-offset = 0x410;
		hyplog-size-offset = 0x414;
