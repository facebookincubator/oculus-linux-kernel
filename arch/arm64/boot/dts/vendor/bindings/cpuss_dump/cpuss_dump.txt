CPU Subsystem Dump Driver

The CPU Subsystem dump driver is used to dump various hardware entities
like the instruction and data tlbs or the unified tlbs etc. to an
allocated buffer. This allows the data to be analysed in case of corruption.

Required Properties for the cpuss_dump node:
-compatible = "qcom,cpuss-dump";

All child nodes of cpuss_dump node are interpreted as the various hardware
entities which need to be dumped.

Required properties of the dump nodes

- qcom,dump-node: phandle to the acutal cpuss hardware entity present
		  in the cpu map
- qcom,dump-id: The ID within the data dump table where this entry needs to
		be added.

Example:
	msm_cpuss_dump {
		compatible = "qcom,cpuss-dump";
		qcom,itlb_dump100 {
			qcom,dump-node = <&L1_itlb_100>;
			qcom,dump-id = <34>;
		};
	};
