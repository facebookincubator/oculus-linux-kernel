Regulator Proxy Consumer Bindings

Regulator proxy consumers provide a means to use a default regulator state
during bootup only which is removed at the end of boot.  This feature can be
used in situations where a shared regulator can be scaled between several
possible voltages and hardware requires that it be at a high level at the
beginning of boot before the consumer device responsible for requesting the
high level has probed.

Supported properties:

- qcom,proxy-consumer-enable
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <empty>
	Definition: Boolean flag indicating that the regulator must be kept
		    enabled during boot.

- qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: List of two integers corresponding the minimum and maximum
		    voltage in microvolts allowed during boot.

- qcom,proxy-consumer-current
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Minimum current in microamps required during boot.

- qcom,proxy-consumer-name
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Name of the proxy consumer supply.  If not specified,
		    "proxy" is assumed.

- <proxy-consumer-name>-supply
	Usage:      required if qcom,proxy-consumer-enable,
		    qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage, or qcom,proxy-consumer-current
		    is specified
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: phandle of the regulator's own device node.
		    <proxy-consumer-name> is defined in qcom,proxy-consumer-name
		    or "proxy" if qcom,proxy-consumer-name isn't present.

Examples:

foo_vreg: regulator@0 {
	regulator-name = "foo";
	regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
	regulator-max-microvolt = <2000000>;
	proxy-supply = <&foo_vreg>;
	qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage = <1500000 2000000>;
	qcom,proxy-consumer-current = <25000>;
	qcom,proxy-consumer-enable;
};

pmic {
	compatible = "foo_pmic";
	ldo1-proxy-supply = <&ldo1>;
	ldo2-proxy-supply = <&ldo2>;

	ldo1: ldo1 {
		regulator-name = "ldo1";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <2000000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-name = "ldo1-proxy";
		qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage = <1500000 2000000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-current = <25000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-enable;
	};

	ldo2: ldo2 {
		regulator-name = "ldo2";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <2000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <3000000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-name = "ldo2-proxy";
		qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage = <2500000 3000000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-current = <50000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-enable;
	};
};
