Regulator Proxy Consumer Bindings

Regulator proxy consumers provide a means to use a default regulator state
during bootup only which is removed at the end of boot.  This feature can be
used in situations where a shared regulator can be scaled between several
possible voltages and hardware requires that it be at a high level at the
beginning of boot before the consumer device responsible for requesting the
high level has probed.

Optional properties:
proxy-supply:			phandle of the regulator's own device node.
				This property is required if any of the three
				properties below are specified.
qcom,proxy-consumer-enable:	Boolean indicating that the regulator must be
				kept enabled during boot.
qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage:	List of two integers corresponding the minimum
				and maximum voltage allowed during boot in
				microvolts.
qcom,proxy-consumer-current:	Minimum current in microamps required during
				boot.

Example:

	foo_vreg: regulator@0 {
		regulator-name = "foo";
		regulator-min-microvolt = <1000000>;
		regulator-max-microvolt = <2000000>;
		proxy-supply = <&foo_vreg>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-voltage = <1500000 2000000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-current = <25000>;
		qcom,proxy-consumer-enable;
	};
