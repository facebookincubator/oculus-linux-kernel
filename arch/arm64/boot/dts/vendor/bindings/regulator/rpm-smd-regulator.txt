Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. RPM Regulators

rpm-regulator-smd is a regulator driver which supports regulators inside of
PMICs which are controlled by the RPM processor.  Communication with the RPM
processor takes place over SMD.

Required structure:
- RPM regulators must be described in two levels of devices nodes.  The first
	level describes the interface with the RPM.  The second level describes
	properties of one regulator framework interface (of potentially many) to
	the regulator.

[First Level Nodes]

Required properties:
- compatible:          Must be "qcom,rpm-smd-regulator-resource"
- qcom,resource-name:  Resource name string for this regulator to be used in RPM
			transactions.  Length is 4 characters max.
- qcom,resource-id:    Resource instance ID for this regulator to be used in RPM
			transactions.
- qcom,regulator-type: Type of this regulator.  Supported values are:
				0 = LDO
				1 = SMPS
				2 = VS
				3 = NCP
				4 = Buck or Boost (BoB)

Optional properties:
- qcom,allow-atomic:   Flag specifying if atomic access is allowed for this
			regulator.  Supported values are:
				0 or not present = mutex locks used
				1 = spinlocks used
- qcom,enable-time:    Time in us to delay after enabling the regulator
- qcom,hpm-min-load:   Load current in uA which corresponds to the minimum load
			which requires the regulator to be in high power mode.
- qcom,apps-only:      Flag which indicates that the regulator only has
			consumers on the application processor. If this flag
			is specified, then voltage and current updates are
			only sent to the RPM if the regulator is enabled.
- qcom,always-wait-for-ack:   Flag which indicates that the application
			processor must wait for an ACK or a NACK from the RPM
			for every request sent for this regulator including
			those which are for a strictly lower power state.

- qcom,regulator-hw-type: Specifies the regulator LDO hardware type. This
			  property must be specified if "qcom,regulator-type"
			  has been specified with a value of 0 (LDO).

			  Must be one of the below:
			  "pmic4-ldo" for PMIC4.
			  "pmic5-ldo" for PMIC5.

[Second Level Nodes]

Required properties:
- compatible:          Must be "qcom,rpm-smd-regulator"
- regulator-name:      A string used as a descriptive name for regulator outputs
- qcom,set:            Specifies which sets that requests made with this
			regulator interface should be sent to.  Regulator
			requests sent in the active set take effect immediately.
			Requests sent in the sleep set take effect when the Apps
			processor transitions into RPM assisted power collapse.
			Supported values are:
				1 = Active set only
				2 = Sleep set only
				3 = Both active and sleep sets



Optional properties:
- parent-supply:               phandle to the parent supply/regulator node
- qcom,system-load:            Load in uA present on regulator that is not
				captured by any consumer request
- qcom,use-voltage-corner:     Flag that signifies if regulator_set_voltage
				calls should modify the corner parameter instead
				of the voltage parameter.  When used, voltages
				specified inside of the regulator framework
				represent corners that have been incremented by
				1.  This value shift is necessary to work around
				limitations in the regulator framework which
				treat 0 uV as an error.
- qcom,use-voltage-floor-corner:  Flag that signifies if regulator_set_voltage
				calls should modify the floor corner parameter
				instead of the voltage parameter.  When used,
				voltages specified inside of the regulator
				framework represent corners that have been
				incremented by 1.  The properties
				qcom,use-voltage-corner and
				qcom,use-voltage-floor-corner are mutually
				exclusive.  Only one may be specified for a
				given regulator.
- qcom,use-voltage-level:      Flag that signifies if regulator_set_voltage
				calls should modify the level parameter instead
				of the voltage parameter.
- qcom,use-voltage-floor-level:   Flag that signifies if regulator_set_voltage
				calls should modify the floor level parameter
				instead of the voltage parameter.
				The properties qcom,use-voltage-level and
				qcom,use-voltage-floor-level are mutually
				exclusive.  Only one may be specified for a
				given regulator.
- qcom,use-pin-ctrl-voltage1:  Flag which indicates that updates to voltage
				should be sent to the pin control voltage 1
				parameter. Only one pin may be specified per
				regulator. This property only applies to BoB
				type regulators.
- qcom,use-pin-ctrl-voltage2:  Flag which indicates that updates to voltage
				should be sent to the pin control voltage 2
				parameter. Only one pin may be specified per
				regulator. This property only applies to BoB
				type regulators.
- qcom,use-pin-ctrl-voltage3:  Flag which indicates that updates to voltage
				should be sent to the pin control voltage 3
				parameter. Only one pin may be specified per
				regulator. This property only applies to BoB
				type regulators.
- qcom,always-send-voltage:    Flag which indicates that updates to the
				voltage, voltage corner or voltage level set
				point should always be sent immediately to the
				RPM. If this flag is not specified, then
				voltage set point updates are only sent if the
				given regulator has also been enabled by a
				Linux consumer.
- qcom,always-send-current:    Flag which indicates that updates to the load
				current should always be sent immediately to the
				RPM.  If this flag is not specified, then load
				current updates are only sent if the given
				regulator has also been enabled by a Linux
				consumer.
- qcom,send-defaults:          Boolean flag which indicates that the initial
				parameter values should be sent to the RPM
				before consumers make their own requests.  If
				this flag is not specified, then initial
				parameters values will only be sent after some
				consumer makes a request.
- qcom,enable-with-pin-ctrl:   Double in which the first element corresponds to
				the pin control enable parameter value to send
				when all consumers have requested the regulator
				to be disabled.  The second element corresponds
				to the pin control enable parameter value to
				send when any consumer has requested the
				regulator to be enabled.  Each element supports
				the same set of values as the
				qcom,init-pin-ctrl-enable property listed below.

The following properties specify initial values for parameters to be sent to the
RPM in regulator requests.
- qcom,init-enable:            0 = regulator disabled
			       1 = regulator enabled
- qcom,init-voltage:           Voltage in uV
- qcom,init-current:           Current in mA
- qcom,init-ldo-mode:          Operating mode to be used with LDO regulators
				Supported values are:
					0 = mode determined by current requests
					1 = force HPM (NPM)
- qcom,init-smps-mode:         Operating mode to be used with SMPS regulators
				Supported values are:
					0 = auto; hardware determines mode
					1 = mode determined by current requests
					2 = force HPM (PWM)
- qcom,init-bob-mode:          Operating mode to be used with BoB regulators
				Supported values are:
					0 = pass; use priority order
					1 = force PFM
					2 = auto; hardware determines mode
					3 = force PWM
- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-enable:   Bit mask specifying which hardware pins should be
				used to enable the regulator, if any; supported
				bits are:
					0 = ignore all hardware enable signals
					BIT(0) = follow HW0_EN signal
					BIT(1) = follow HW1_EN signal
					BIT(2) = follow HW2_EN signal
					BIT(3) = follow HW3_EN signal
- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-mode:     Bit mask specifying which hardware pins should be
				used to force the regulator into high power
				mode, if any.  Supported bits are:
					0 = ignore all hardware enable signals
					BIT(0) = follow HW0_EN signal
					BIT(1) = follow HW1_EN signal
					BIT(2) = follow HW2_EN signal
					BIT(3) = follow HW3_EN signal
					BIT(4) = follow PMIC awake state
- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-voltage1: Minimum voltage in micro-volts to use while pin
				control 1 is enabled. This property only
				applies to BoB type regulators.
- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-voltage2: Minimum voltage in micro-volts to use while pin
				control 2 is enabled. This property only
				applies to BoB type regulators.
- qcom,init-pin-ctrl-voltage3: Minimum voltage in micro-volts to use while pin
				control 3 is enabled. This property only
				applies to BoB type regulators.
- qcom,init-frequency:         Switching frequency divisor for SMPS regulators.
				Supported values are n = 0 to 31 where
				freq = 19.2 MHz / (n + 1).
- qcom,init-head-room:         Voltage head room in mV required for the
				regulator.  This head room value should be used
				in situations where the device connected to the
				output of the regulator has low noise tolerance.
				Note that the RPM independently enforces a
				safety head room value for subregulated LDOs
				which is sufficient to account for LDO drop-out
				voltage.
- qcom,init-quiet-mode:        Specify that quiet mode is needed for an SMPS
				regulator in order to have lower output noise.
				Supported values are:
					0 = No quiet mode
					1 = Quiet mode
					2 = Super quiet mode
- qcom,init-freq-reason:       Consumer requiring specified frequency for an
				SMPS regulator.  Supported values are:
					0 = None
					1 = Bluetooth
					2 = GPS
					4 = WLAN
					8 = WAN
- qcom,init-voltage-corner:    Performance corner to use in order to determine
				voltage set point.  This value corresponds to
				the actual value that will be sent and is not
				incremented by 1 like the values used inside of
				the regulator framework.  The meaning of corner
				values is set by the RPM.  It is possible that
				different regulators on a given platform or
				similar regulators on different platforms will
				utilize different corner values.  These are
				corner values supported on MSM8974 for PMIC
				PM8841 SMPS 2 (VDD_Dig); nominal voltages for
				these corners are also shown:
					0 = None         (don't care)
					1 = Retention    (0.5000 V)
					2 = SVS Krait    (0.7250 V)
					3 = SVS SOC      (0.8125 V)
					4 = Normal       (0.9000 V)
					5 = Turbo        (0.9875 V)
					6 = Super Turbo  (1.0500 V)
- qcom,init-disallow-bypass:   Specify that bypass mode should not be used for a
				given LDO regulator.  When in bypass mode, an
				LDO performs no regulation and acts as a simple
				switch.  The RPM can utilize this mode for an
				LDO that is subregulated from an SMPS when it is
				possible to reduce the SMPS voltage to the
				desired LDO output level.  Bypass mode may be
				disallowed if lower LDO output noise is
				required.  Supported values are:
					0 = Allow RPM to utilize LDO bypass mode
						if possible
					1 = Disallow LDO bypass mode
- qcom,init-voltage-floor-corner:  Minimum performance corner to use if any
				processor in the system is awake.  This property
				supports the same values as
				qcom,init-voltage-corner.
- qcom,init-voltage-level:     Performance level to use in order to determine
				voltage set point. The meaning of level
				values is set by the RPM. It is possible that
				different regulators on a given platform or
				similar regulators on different platforms will
				utilize different level values. These are
				level values supported on MSM8952 for PMIC
				PM8952 SMPS 2 (VDD_Dig); nominal voltages for
				these level are also shown:
					16  = Retention    (0.5000 V)
					128 = SVS          (1.0500 V)
					192 = SVS+         (1.1550 V)
					256 = Normal       (1.2250 V)
					320 = Normal+      (1.2875 V)
					384 = Turbo        (1.3500 V)
- qcom,init-voltage-floor-level:   Minimum performance level to use if any
				processor in the system is awake. This property
				supports the same values as
				qcom,init-voltage-level.

All properties specified within the core regulator framework can also be used in
second level nodes.  These bindings can be found in:
