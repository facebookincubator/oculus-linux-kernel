STMicroelectronics STM32 Low-Power Timer PWM

STM32 Low-Power Timer provides single channel PWM.

Must be a sub-node of an STM32 Low-Power Timer device tree node.
See ../mfd/stm32-lptimer.txt for details about the parent node.

Required parameters:
- compatible:		Must be "st,stm32-pwm-lp".
- #pwm-cells:		Should be set to 3. This PWM chip uses the default 3 cells
			bindings defined in pwm.txt.

Optional properties:
- pinctrl-names: 	Set to "default".
- pinctrl-0: 		Phandle pointing to pin configuration node for PWM.

Example:
	timer@40002400 {
		compatible = "st,stm32-lptimer";
		...
		pwm {
			compatible = "st,stm32-pwm-lp";
			#pwm-cells = <3>;
			pinctrl-names = "default";
			pinctrl-0 = <&lppwm1_pins>;
		};
	};
