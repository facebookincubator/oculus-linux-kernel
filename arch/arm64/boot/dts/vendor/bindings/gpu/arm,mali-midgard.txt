ARM Mali Midgard GPU
====================

Required properties:

- compatible :
  * Must contain one of the following:
    + "arm,mali-t604"
    + "arm,mali-t624"
    + "arm,mali-t628"
    + "arm,mali-t720"
    + "arm,mali-t760"
    + "arm,mali-t820"
    + "arm,mali-t830"
    + "arm,mali-t860"
    + "arm,mali-t880"
  * which must be preceded by one of the following vendor specifics:
    + "amlogic,meson-gxm-mali"
    + "rockchip,rk3288-mali"
    + "rockchip,rk3399-mali"

- reg : Physical base address of the device and length of the register area.

- interrupts : Contains the three IRQ lines required by Mali Midgard devices.

- interrupt-names : Contains the names of IRQ resources in the order they were
  provided in the interrupts property. Must contain: "job", "mmu", "gpu".


Optional properties:

- clocks : Phandle to clock for the Mali Midgard device.

- mali-supply : Phandle to regulator for the Mali device. Refer to
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt for details.

- operating-points-v2 : Refer to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/opp/opp.txt
  for details.


Example for a Mali-T760:

	compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-mali", "arm,mali-t760";
	reg = <0xffa30000 0x10000>;

		     <GIC_SPI 7 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>,
		     <GIC_SPI 8 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	interrupt-names = "job", "mmu", "gpu";
	clocks = <&cru ACLK_GPU>;
	mali-supply = <&vdd_gpu>;
	operating-points-v2 = <&gpu_opp_table>;
	power-domains = <&power RK3288_PD_GPU>;
};

gpu_opp_table: opp_table0 {
	compatible = "operating-points-v2";

	opp@533000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <533000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1250000>;
	};
	opp@450000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <450000000>;

	};
	opp@266000000 {
		opp-hz = /bits/ 64 <266000000>;
		opp-microvolt = <1025000>;
	};
	opp@160000000 {
