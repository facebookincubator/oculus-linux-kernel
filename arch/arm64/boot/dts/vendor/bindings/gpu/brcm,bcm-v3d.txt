Broadcom V3D GPU

Only the Broadcom V3D 3.x and newer GPUs are covered by this binding.
For V3D 2.x, see brcm,bcm-vc4.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "brcm,7268-v3d" or "brcm,7278-v3d"
- reg:		Physical base addresses and lengths of the register areas
- reg-names:	Names for the register areas.  The "hub", "bridge", and "core0"
		  register areas are always required.  The "gca" register area
		  is required if the GCA cache controller is present.
- interrupts:	The interrupt numbers.  The first interrupt is for the hub,
		  while the following interrupts are for the cores.
		  See bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Optional properties:
- clocks:	The core clock the unit runs on
