Texas Instruments TAS5805M audio amplifier

The TAS5805M serial control bus communicates through I2C protocols.

Required properties:
	- compatible: "ti,tas5805m".
	- reg: 7-bit I2C address.
	- gpio,pdn: A GPIO spec to define which pin is connected to the
			chip's active-low power down pin.

Optional properties:
	- gpio,hpd: GPIO used to detect external interrupt event. If specified,
			the driver will mute tas5805m if this GPIO is high.
			Unmute if this GPIO is low.


Example:

tas5805m@2d {
	compatible = "ti,tas5805m";
	reg = <0x2d>;
	gpio,pdn = <&tlmm 127 0>;

	interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
	interrupts = <32 0>;
	gpio,hpd = <&tlmm 32 0>;

	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spkr_2_sd_n_sleep &line_out_hpd_default>;
};
