This document describes the device tree binding for IOMMU test devices.

The iommu-debug framework can optionally make use of some platform devices
for improved standalone testing and other features.

- compatible: iommu-debug-test


Required properties
===================

- iommus: The IOMMU for the test device (see iommu.txt)


Example
=======

	iommu_test_device {
		compatible = "iommu-debug-test";
		/*
		 * 42 shouldn't be used by anyone on the cpp_fd_smmu.  We just
		 * need _something_ here to get this node recognized by the
		 * SMMU driver. Our test uses ATOS, which doesn't use SIDs
		 * anyways, so using a dummy value is ok.
		 */
		iommus = <&cpp_fd_smmu 42>;
	};
