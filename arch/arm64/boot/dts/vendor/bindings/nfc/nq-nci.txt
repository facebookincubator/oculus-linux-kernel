Qualcomm Technologies, Inc NQxxxx NFC NCI device

Near Field Communication (NFC) device is based on NFC Controller Interface (NCI)

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,nq-nci"
- reg: NCI i2c slave address.
- qcom,nq-ven: specific gpio for hardware reset.
- qcom,nq-irq: specific gpio for read interrupt.
- qcom,nq-firm: gpio for firmware download
- qcom,nq-clkreq: gpio for clock
- interrupt-parent: Should be phandle for the interrupt controller
                    that services interrupts for this device.
- interrupts: Nfc read interrupt,gpio-clk-req interrupt


Recommended properties:

- interrupt-names: names of interrupts, should include "nfc_irq", used for reference


Optional properties:

- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0, pincntrl-1: references to our pincntrl settings
- clocks, clock-names: must contain the NQxxxx's core clock.
- qcom,nq-esepwr: gpio to control power of secure element
- qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-supply: name of LDO to which NFC is connected
- qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-voltage: min and max voltage(in uV) requirement for NFC
- qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-current: max current(in uA) expected by NFC
- qcom,clk-src: NFC clock for antenna

Example:

	nq-nci@2b {
		compatible = "qcom,nq-nci";
		reg = <0x2b>;
		qcom,nq-irq = <&tlmm 29 0x00>;
		qcom,nq-ven = <&tlmm 30 0x00>;
		qcom,nq-firm = <&tlmm 93 0x00>;
		qcom,nq-clkreq = <&pm8998_gpios 21 0x00>;
		qcom,nq-esepwr = <&tlmm 116 0x00>;
		qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-supply = <&L11A>;
		qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-voltage = <1800000 1800000>;
		qcom,nq-vdd-1p8-current = <157000>;
		qcom,clk-src = "BBCLK2";
		interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
		interrupts = <29 0>;
		interrupt-names = "nfc_irq";
		pinctrl-names = "nfc_active","nfc_suspend";
		pinctrl-0 = <&nfc_int_active &nfc_disable_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&nfc_int_suspend &nfc_disable_suspend>;
		clocks = <&clock_rpm clk_bb_clk2_pin>;
		clock-names = "ref_clk";
	};
