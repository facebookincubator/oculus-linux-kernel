Qualcomm Technologies, Inc SNxxx NFC NCI device

Near Field Communication (NFC) device is based on NFC Controller Interface (NCI).
Refer to I3C bindings file for more information.

Required properties:

- compatible: "qcom,sn-nci-i3c"
- reg: NFC I3C device's PID.
- qcom,sn-ven: specific gpio for hardware reset.
- qcom,sn-firm: gpio for firmware download
- qcom,sn-clkreq: gpio for clock.

Optional properties:

- pinctrl-names, pinctrl-0, pincntrl-1: references to our pincntrl settings.
- clocks, clock-names: must contain the SNxxx's core clock.
- qcom,clk-src: NFC clock for antenna.
- assigned-address: If specific I3C dynamic address is required it can be specified here.

Example:

	sn@0,23600000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sn-nci-i3c";
		reg = <0 0x236 0x00000000>;
		assigned-address = <0xa>;
		qcom,sn-ven = <&tlmm 62 0x01>;
		qcom,sn-firm = <&tlmm 86 0x00>;
		qcom,sn-clkreq = <&tlmm 63 0x00>;
		qcom,clk-src = "BBCLK2";
		pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
		pinctrl-0 = <&nfc_fwdl_active &nfc_clk_req_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&nfc_fwdl_suspend &nfc_clk_req_suspend>;
		clocks = <&clock_rpm clk_bb_clk2_pin>;
		clock-names = "ref_clk";
		status = "ok";
	};
