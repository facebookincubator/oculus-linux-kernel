* Qualcomm technologies inc, DMA engine driver for BAM (Bus Access Manager).

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,sps-dma".
- reg: Should contain DMA registers location and length. This should include
  all of the per-channel registers.
- interrupts: Should contain the BAM interrupt number.
- qcom,summing-threshold:  Should contain the BAM event threshold of
  the sum of descriptors' sizes in bytes.

Optional properties:
- qcom,managed-locally : Use when BAM global device control is managed locally
  by the application processor.

Example:

	dma_blsp1: qcom,sps-dma@f9904000 { /* BLSP1 */
		#dma-cells = <4>;
		compatible = "qcom,sps-dma";
		reg = <0xf9904000 0x19000>;
		interrupts = <0 238 0>;
		qcom,summing-threshold = <10>;
	};

DMA clients connected to the qcom-sps-dma DMA controller must use the format
described in the dma.txt file, using a five-cell specifier for each channel,
a phandle plus four integer cells, as shown below:

dmas = <[phandle of the dma controller] [pipe index] [number of descriptors]
				[sps_connect flags] [sps_register_event flags]>;

Example:

i2c_2: i2c@f9924000 { /* BLSP1 QUP2 */
	.
	.
	.
	/*     <&phandle pipe-idx n-descs connect-flags event-flags> */
	dmas = <&dma_blsp1 14 32 0x20000020 0x20>,
	       <&dma_blsp1 15 64 0x20000020 0x20>;
	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
};
