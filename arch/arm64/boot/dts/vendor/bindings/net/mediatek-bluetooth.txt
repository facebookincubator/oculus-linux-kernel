MediaTek SoC built-in Bluetooth Devices
==================================

This device is a serial attached device to BTIF device and thus it must be a
child node of the serial node with BTIF. The dt-bindings details for BTIF
device can be known via Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/8250.txt.

Required properties:

- compatible:	Must be
		  "mediatek,mt7622-bluetooth": for MT7622 SoC
- clocks:	Should be the clock specifiers corresponding to the entry in
		clock-names property.
- clock-names:	Should contain "ref" entries.
- power-domains: Phandle to the power domain that the device is part of

Example:

	btif: serial@1100c000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt7622-btif",
			     "mediatek,mtk-btif";
		reg = <0 0x1100c000 0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 90 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;
		clocks = <&pericfg CLK_PERI_BTIF_PD>;
		clock-names = "main";
		reg-shift = <2>;
		reg-io-width = <4>;

		bluetooth {
			compatible = "mediatek,mt7622-bluetooth";
			power-domains = <&scpsys MT7622_POWER_DOMAIN_WB>;
			clocks = <&clk25m>;
			clock-names = "ref";
		};
	};
