XILINX AXI ETHERNET Device Tree Bindings
--------------------------------------------------------

Also called  AXI 1G/2.5G Ethernet Subsystem, the xilinx axi ethernet IP core
provides connectivity to an external ethernet PHY supporting different
interfaces: MII, GMII, RGMII, SGMII, 1000BaseX. It also includes two
segments of memory for buffering TX and RX, as well as the capability of
offloading TX/RX checksum calculation off the processor.

Management configuration is done through the AXI interface, while payload is
sent and received through means of an AXI DMA controller. This driver
includes the DMA driver code, so this driver is incompatible with AXI DMA
driver.

For more details about mdio please refer phy.txt file in the same directory.

Required properties:
- compatible	: Must be one of "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a",
		  "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.01.a", "xlnx,axi-ethernet-2.01.a"
- reg		: Address and length of the IO space.
- interrupts	: Should be a list of two interrupt, TX and RX.
- phy-handle	: Should point to the external phy device.
		  See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
- xlnx,rxmem	: Set to allocated memory buffer for Rx/Tx in the hardware

Optional properties:
- phy-mode	: See ethernet.txt
- xlnx,phy-type	: Deprecated, do not use, but still accepted in preference
		  to phy-mode.
- xlnx,txcsum	: 0 or empty for disabling TX checksum offload,
		  1 to enable partial TX checksum offload,
		  2 to enable full TX checksum offload
- xlnx,rxcsum	: Same values as xlnx,txcsum but for RX checksum offload

Example:
	axi_ethernet_eth: ethernet@40c00000 {
		compatible = "xlnx,axi-ethernet-1.00.a";
		device_type = "network";
		interrupt-parent = <&microblaze_0_axi_intc>;
		interrupts = <2 0>;
		phy-mode = "mii";
		reg = <0x40c00000 0x40000>;
		xlnx,rxcsum = <0x2>;
		xlnx,rxmem = <0x800>;
		xlnx,txcsum = <0x2>;
		phy-handle = <&phy0>;
		axi_ethernetlite_0_mdio: mdio {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;
			phy0: phy@0 {
				device_type = "ethernet-phy";
				reg = <1>;
			};
		};
	};
