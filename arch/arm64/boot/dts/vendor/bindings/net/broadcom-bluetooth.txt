Broadcom Bluetooth Chips
---------------------

This documents the binding structure and common properties for serial
attached Broadcom devices.

Serial attached Broadcom devices shall be a child node of the host UART
device the slave device is attached to.

Required properties:

 - compatible: should contain one of the following:
   * "brcm,bcm43438-bt"

Optional properties:

 - max-speed: see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/serial/slave-device.txt
 - shutdown-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to enable the BT module
 - device-wakeup-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to wakeup the controller
 - host-wakeup-gpios: GPIO specifier, used to wakeup the host processor
 - clocks: clock specifier if external clock provided to the controller
 - clock-names: should be "extclk"


Example:

&uart2 {
       pinctrl-names = "default";
       pinctrl-0 = <&uart2_pins>;

       bluetooth {
               compatible = "brcm,bcm43438-bt";
               max-speed = <921600>;
       };
};
