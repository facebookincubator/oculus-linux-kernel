Vitesse VSC73xx Switches
========================

This defines device tree bindings for the Vitesse VSC73xx switch chips.
The Vitesse company has been acquired by Microsemi and Microsemi in turn
acquired by Microchip but retains this vendor branding.

The currently supported switch chips are:
Vitesse VSC7385 SparX-G5 5+1-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch
Vitesse VSC7388 SparX-G8 8-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch
Vitesse VSC7395 SparX-G5e 5+1-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch
Vitesse VSC7398 SparX-G8e 8-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch

The device tree node is an SPI device so it must reside inside a SPI bus
device tree node, see spi/spi-bus.txt

Required properties:

- compatible: must be exactly one of:
	"vitesse,vsc7385"
	"vitesse,vsc7388"
	"vitesse,vsc7395"
	"vitesse,vsc7398"
- gpio-controller: indicates that this switch is also a GPIO controller,
  see gpio/gpio.txt
- #gpio-cells: this must be set to <2> and indicates that we are a twocell
  GPIO controller, see gpio/gpio.txt

Optional properties:

- reset-gpios: a handle to a GPIO line that can issue reset of the chip.
  It should be tagged as active low.

Required subnodes:

See net/dsa/dsa.txt for a list of additional required and optional properties
and subnodes of DSA switches.

Examples:

switch@0 {
	compatible = "vitesse,vsc7395";
	reg = <0>;
	/* Specified for 2.5 MHz or below */
	spi-max-frequency = <2500000>;
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <2>;

	ports {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		port@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			label = "lan1";
		};
		port@1 {
			reg = <1>;
			label = "lan2";
		};
		port@2 {
			reg = <2>;
			label = "lan3";
		};
		port@3 {
			reg = <3>;
			label = "lan4";
		};
		vsc: port@6 {
			reg = <6>;
			label = "cpu";
			ethernet = <&gmac1>;
			phy-mode = "rgmii";
			fixed-link {
				speed = <1000>;
				full-duplex;
				pause;
			};
		};
	};
};
