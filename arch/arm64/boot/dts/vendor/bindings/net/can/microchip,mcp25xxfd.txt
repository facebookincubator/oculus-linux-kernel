* Microchip MCP2517 stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following:
   - "microchip,mcp2517fd" for MCP2517fd.
 - reg: SPI chip select.
 - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
 - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
 - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.
 - gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller

Optional properties:
 - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
 - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.
 - microchip,clock_out_div = <0|1|2|4|10>: Clock output pin divider
					   0 = Start of Frame output
					   default: 10
 - microchip,clock_div2: bool: divide the internal clock by 2
 - gpio_opendrain: bool: enable open-drain for all pins (except cantx)

Example:
	can0: can@1 {
		compatible = "microchip,mcp2517fd";
		reg = <1>;
		clocks = <&clk24m>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio4>;
		interrupts = <13 0x8>;
		vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
		gpio-controller;
	};
