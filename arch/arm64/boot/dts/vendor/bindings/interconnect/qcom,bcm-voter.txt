QTI BCM-Voter interconnect driver binding
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Bus Clock Manager (BCM) is a dedicated hardware accelerator
that manages shared system resources by aggregating requests
from multiple Resource State Coordinators (RSC). Interconnect
providers are able to vote for aggregated thresholds values from
consumers by communicating through their respective RSCs.

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,sdm845-bcm-voter",
			"qcom,bcm-voter",

Examples:

apps_rsc: interconnect@179c0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,rpmh-rsc";

	apps_bcm_voter: bcm_voter {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-bcm-voter";
	};
}

disp_rsc: interconnect@179d0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,rpmh-rsc";

	disp_bcm_voter: bcm_voter {
		compatible = "qcom,sdm845-bcm-voter";
	};
}
