* MSM Serial UART for GENI based cores.

The MSM serial UART driver supports low speed and high speed use-cases.
This is meant only for QUPv3 GENI based cores and isn't backwards compatible.
There is support for console usecases and for higher speed usecases that need
DMA.

Required properties:
- compatible: should contain "qcom,msm-geni-uart, qcom,msm-geni-console"
  for UART console usecases, "qcom,msm-geni-uart, qcom,msm-geni-serial-hs"
  for High Speed (HS) usecases.
- reg: Should contain UART register location and length.
- interrupts: Should contain UART core interrupts.
- clocks: clocks needed for UART, includes the core and AHB clock.
- pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
  Should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
  or when entering sleep state.
- qcom,wrapper-core: Wrapper QUPv3 core containing this UART controller.

Optional properties:
- qcom,wakeup-byte: Byte to be injected in the tty layer during wakeup isr.
- qcom,change-sampling-rate: This is a boolean parameter and use this to decide
  the samping rate at which sequencer engine runs.

Example:
qupv3_uart11: qcom,qup_uart@0xa88000 {
	compatible = "qcom,msm-geni-uart";
	reg = <0xa88000 0x7000>;
	reg-names = "se_phys";
	clock-names = "se-clk", "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S0_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_uart_3_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_uart_3_sleep>;
	interrupts = <0 355 0>;
	qcom,wrapper-core = <&qupv3_0>;
	qcom,change-sampling-rate;
	qcom,wakeup-byte = <0xFF>;
};
