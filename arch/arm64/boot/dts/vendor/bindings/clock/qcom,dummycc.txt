Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Dummy Clock Controller Binding

Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. dummy clock controller devices provide
clock API support for driver development during pre-silicon stage.
The clock driver always returns a dummy clock that has no effect on
hardware.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,dummycc"
- #clock-cells:		Must be <1>. This will allow the common clock device
			tree framework to recognize _this_ device node as a
			clock provider.

Optional properties:
- clock-output-names:	Name of the clock or the clock type.
- #reset-cells:		Must be <1>. This will allow the common reset device
			tree framework to recognize _this_ device node as a
			reset controller provider.

Example:
	clock_gcc: qcom,gcc {
		compatible = "qcom,dummycc";
		clock-output-names = "gcc_clocks";
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		#reset-cells = <1>;
	};
