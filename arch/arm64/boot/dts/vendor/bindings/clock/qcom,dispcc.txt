Required properties :

- compatible : Shall contain one of the following:
		"qcom,kona-dispcc",
		"qcom,sdm845-dispcc"
		"qcom,lito-dispcc"
		"qcom,bengal-dispcc"
		"qcom,lagoon-dispcc"
		"qcom,scuba-dispcc"
		"qcom,khaje-dispcc".
- reg : shall contain base register location and length.
- vdd_mm-supply: phandle to the MM_CX rail that needs to be voted on behalf
of the clocks.
- clock-names: Shall contain "cfg_ahb_clk"
- clocks: phandle clock reference to the GCC AHB clock.
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding, shall contain 1.
- #reset-cells : from common reset binding, shall contain 1.
- #power-domain-cells : from generic power domain binding, shall contain 1.

Optional properties :

- reg-names: Address name. Must be "cc_base".
