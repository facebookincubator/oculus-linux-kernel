Ingenic jz47xx pin controller

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

For the jz47xx SoCs, pin control is tightly bound with GPIO ports. All pins may
be used as GPIOs, multiplexed device functions are configured within the
GPIO port configuration registers and it is typical to refer to pins using the
naming scheme "PxN" where x is a character identifying the GPIO port with
which the pin is associated and N is an integer from 0 to 31 identifying the
pin within that GPIO port. For example PA0 is the first pin in GPIO port A, and
PB31 is the last pin in GPIO port B. The jz4740 contains 4 GPIO ports, PA to
PD, for a total of 128 pins. The jz4780 contains 6 GPIO ports, PA to PF, for a
total of 192 pins.


Required properties:
--------------------

 - compatible: One of:
    - "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl"
    - "ingenic,jz4770-pinctrl"
    - "ingenic,jz4780-pinctrl"
 - reg: Address range of the pinctrl registers.


GPIO sub-nodes
--------------

The pinctrl node can have optional sub-nodes for the Ingenic GPIO driver;
please refer to ../gpio/ingenic,gpio.txt.


Example:
--------

pinctrl: pin-controller@10010000 {
	compatible = "ingenic,jz4740-pinctrl";
	reg = <0x10010000 0x400>;
};
