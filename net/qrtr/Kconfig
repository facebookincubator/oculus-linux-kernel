# Qualcomm IPC Router configuration
#

config QRTR
	tristate "Qualcomm IPC Router support"
	depends on ARCH_QCOM || COMPILE_TEST
	---help---
	  Say Y if you intend to use Qualcomm IPC router protocol.  The
	  protocol is used to communicate with services provided by other
	  hardware blocks in the system.

	  In order to do service lookups, a userspace daemon is required to
	  maintain a service listing.

if QRTR

config QRTR_WAKEUP_MS
	int "QRTR Wakeup timeout"
	default 0
	help
	  This option is used to configure the wakesource timeout that QRTR
	  should take when a packet is received. The qrtr driver can guarantee
	  that the packet gets queued to the socket but cannot guarantee the
	  client process will get time to run if auto sleep is enabled. This
	  config will help mitigate missed packets on systems where auto sleep
	  is aggressive.

config QRTR_SMD
	tristate "SMD IPC Router channels"
	depends on RPMSG || (COMPILE_TEST && RPMSG=n)
	---help---
	  Say Y here to support SMD based ipcrouter channels.  SMD is the
	  most common transport for IPC Router.

config QRTR_TUN
	tristate "TUN device for Qualcomm IPC Router"
	---help---
	  Say Y here to expose a character device that allows user space to
	  implement endpoints of QRTR, for purpose of tunneling data to other
	  hosts or testing purposes.

config QRTR_MHI
	tristate "MHI IPC Router channels"
	depends on MHI_BUS || (COMPILE_TEST && MHI_BUS=n)
	help
	  Say Y here to support MHI based ipcrouter channels.  MHI is the
	  transport used for external modem connections for IPC Router. The
	  MHI bus provides an asynchronous send mechanism, the QRTR MHI
	  transport will wait for the uplink callback notification before
	  returning to qrtr.

config QRTR_USB
	tristate "USB IPC Router channels"
	depends on USB || (COMPILE_TEST && USB=n)
	help
	  Say Y here to support USB based ipcrouter channels. USB transport
	  is used for connections with other sytems for IPC Router. The USB
	  transport provides bulk endpoints to facilitate sending and receiving
	  IPC Router data packets.

config QRTR_FIFO
	tristate "FIFO IPC Router channels"
	help
	Say Y here to support FIFO based ipcrouter channels. FIFO Transport
	Layer enables IPC Router communication between two virtual machines.
	The shared memory between virtual machines will be allocated by the
	hypervisor and signal other VMs through virtualized interrupts.
