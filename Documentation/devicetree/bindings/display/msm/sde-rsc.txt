Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDE RSC

Snapdragon Display Engine implements display rsc to driver
display core to different modes for power saving

Required properties
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,sde-rsc"
- reg:				Offset and length of the register set for
				the device.
- reg-names:			Names to refer to register sets related
				to this device

Optional properties:
- clocks:			List of phandles for clock device nodes
				needed by the device.
- clock-names:			List of clock names needed by the device.
- vdd-supply:			phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- qcom,sde-rsc-version:		U32 property represents the rsc version. It helps to
				select correct sequence for sde rsc based on version.
- qcom,sde-dram-channels:	U32 property represents the number of channels in the
				Bus memory controller.
- qcom,sde-num-nrt-paths:	U32 property represents the number of non-realtime
				paths in each Bus Scaling Usecase. This value depends on
				number of AXI ports that are dedicated to non-realtime VBIF
				for particular chipset.
				These paths must be defined after rt-paths in
				"qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps" vector request.

Bus Scaling Subnodes:
- qcom,sde-data-bus:		Property to provide Bus scaling for data bus access for
				sde blocks.
- qcom,sde-llcc-bus:		Property to provide Bus scaling for data bus access for
				mnoc to llcc.
- qcom,sde-ebi-bus:		Property to provide Bus scaling for data bus access for
				llcc to ebi.

Bus Scaling Data:
- qcom,msm-bus,name:		String property describing client name.
- qcom,msm-bus,active-only:	Boolean context flag for requests in active or
				dual (active & sleep) contex
- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases:	This is the number of Bus Scaling use cases
				defined in the vectors property.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:	This represents the number of paths in each
				Bus Scaling Usecase.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:	* A series of 4 cell properties, with a format
				of (src, dst, ab, ib) which is defined at
				Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt
				* Current values of src & dst are defined at
				include/linux/msm-bus-board.h
