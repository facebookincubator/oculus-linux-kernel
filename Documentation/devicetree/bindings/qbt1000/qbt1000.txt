Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QBT1000 Specific Bindings

QBT is a fingerprint sensor ASIC capable of performing fingerprint image scans
and detecting finger presence on the sensor using programmable firmware.

=======================
Required Node Structure
=======================

- compatible
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: "qcom,qbt1000".

- clock-names
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <stringlist>
  Definition: List of clock names that need to be voted on/off.

- clocks
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop_encoded-array>
  Definition: Property pair that represents the clock controller and the clock
		id. This in combination with the clock-name is used to obtain
		the handle for the clock that needs to be voted on/off.

- clock-frequency
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <u32>
  Definition: Frequency of clock in Hz.

- qcom,ipc-gpio
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: phandle for GPIO to be used for IPC.

- qcom,finger-detect-gpio
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: phandle for GPIO to be used for finger detect.
