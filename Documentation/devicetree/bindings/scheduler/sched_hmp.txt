* HMP scheduler

This file describes the bindings for an optional HMP scheduler
node (/sched-hmp).

Required properties:

Optional properties:

- boost-policy: The HMP scheduler has two types of task placement boost
policies.

(1) boost-on-big policy make use of all big CPUs up to their full capacity
before using the little CPUs. This improves performance on true b.L systems
where the big CPUs have higher efficiency compared to the little CPUs.

(2) boost-on-all policy place the tasks on the CPU having the highest
spare capacity. This policy is optimal for SMP like systems.

The scheduler sets the boost policy to boost-on-big on systems which has
CPUs of different efficiencies. However it is possible that CPUs of the
same micro architecture to have slight difference in efficiency due to
other factors like cache size. Selecting the boost-on-big policy based
on relative difference in efficiency is not optimal on such systems.
The boost-policy device tree property is introduced to specify the
required boost type and it overrides the default selection of boost
type in the scheduler.

The possible values for this property are "boost-on-big" and "boost-on-all".

Example:

sched-hmp {
	boost-policy = "boost-on-all"
}
