* avtimer

Avtimer provides an interface for clients to enable avtimer block
on qdsp6. 64 bit AVtimer exposed by qdsp6 is used for audio and video
stream synchronization during capture and playback usecases.

Required properties:
- reg : physical address and length of avtimer register
- reg-names : AVtimer register name
  Required register resource entries are:
  "avtimer_lsb_addr" : AVtimer lsb physical address
  "avtimer_msb_addr" : AVtimer msb physical address
- compatible : Must be "qcom,avtimer"

Optional properties:
- clk-div : Divisor to divide the ticks value to get msec value.
 If the clock is at 27MHz, the ticks value read from AVTimer
 registers will have to be divided by 27, to achieve the msec value.
- clk-mult : Multiplier to multiply the ticks value in order to avoid
 a floating point operation if the clock is of decimal value.
 E.g. To get msec out of ticks from a 19.2MHz clock source, the ticks
 value will have to be divided by 19.2, which will then become a
 floating point operation. However, to avoid using a floating point
 operation, the msec can be calculated by multiplying ticks with 10
 and dividing the result by 192. i.e. msec = (ticks * 10) / 192;

Example:
	qcom,avtimer@90f7000 {
		compatible = "qcom,avtimer";
		reg = <0x90f700c 0x4>,
		      <0x90f7010 0x4>;
		reg-names = "avtimer_lsb_addr", "avtimer_msb_addr";
		qcom,clk-div = <27>;
		qcom,clk-mult = <10>;
	};
