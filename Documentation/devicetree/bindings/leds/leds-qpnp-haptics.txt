Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Haptics driver

QPNP (Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Plug N Play) Haptics is a peripheral on some
QTI PMICs. It can be interfaced with the host processor via SPMI or I2C bus.

Haptics peripheral can support different actuators or vibrators,
1. Eccentric Rotation Mass (ERM)
2. Linear Resonant Actuator (LRA)

Also, it can support multiple modes of operation: Direct, Buffer, PWM or Audio.

Haptics device is described under a single level of node.
