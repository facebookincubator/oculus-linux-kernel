			  970mA and AMOLED is 620mA.
			  Supported values are:
			  - 105, 280, 450, 620, 970, 1150, 1300, 1500.
- qcom,boost-duty-ns	: maximum boost duty cycle in ns. default is 104.
- qcom,mod-freq-khz	: modulation frequency in khz. default is 9600.
- qcom,dim-mode		: dimming mode. supporting dimming modes are "analog",
			  "digital", and "hybrid". default is "hybrid".
- qcom,hyb-thres	: threshold value when used in hybrid mode. It represents the
			  percentage of brightntess at which dimming mode is switched
			  from "digital" to "analog". the default value is 6.25%. as the
			  floating point cannot be represented directly, the value is
			  multiplied by 100. so the default is 625.
- qcom,sync-dly-us	: delay for current sync in us. default is 400.
- qcom,fs-curr-ua	: maximum full scale current in ua. default is 25000.

- qcom,disp-type-amoled	: specify if the display is amoled
- qcom,led-strings-list	: Wled module has four strings of leds numbered from 0 to 3. each string of leds
			  are operated individually. specify the list of strings used by the device.
			  any combination of led strings can be used. default value is [00 01 02 03]
- qcom,en-ext-pfet-sc-pro : Specify if external pfet short circuit protection is needed
- qcom,cons-sync-write-delay-us : Specify in 'us' the duration of delay between two consecutive writes to
				  SYNC register.

				  Supported values are: 0 - 3.
- qcom,lcd-auto-pfm-thresh	: Specify the auto-pfm threshold, if the headroom voltage level
				  falls below this threshold and auto PFM is enabled, boost
				  controller will enter into PFM mode automatically.
- qcom,lcd-psm-ctrl	: A boolean property to specify if PSM needs to be
			  controlled dynamically when WLED module is enabled
			  or disabled.
- qcom,auto-calibration-enable : A boolean property which enables auto-calibration
				 of the WLED sink configuration.
- qcom,wled-brightness-map	: Array of brightness map codes of size 256.
				  These codes will be mapped to the brightness
				  level requested in the scale of 0-4095. Code
				  entry is of 16 bit size.
- qcom,wled-stepper-en	: A boolean property to specify if stepper algorithm
			  needs to be enabled. This needs the brightness map

			AMOLED_VOUT is programmed via S-wire. This can be specified only for newer
			PMICs like pmi8998/pm660l.
