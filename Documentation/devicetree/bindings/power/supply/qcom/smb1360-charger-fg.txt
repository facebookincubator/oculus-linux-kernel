SMB1360 battery charger and fuel gauge

SMB1360 is a single path switch-mode battery charger and
fuel gauge. The charger has a max current rating of 1.5A.
The fuel gauge uses voltage + coulomb counting to report
the state of charge.

The smb1360 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,smb1360-charger-fg"
- reg:				The device 7-bit I2C address.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ numbers of the GPIOs
				connected to the STAT and usb-id pins.
- interrupt-names		The irq names should be smb1360_stat_irq and
				smb1360_usb_id_irq.The stat irq is mandatory
				and usb_id irq is optional.
- pinctrl-names:		The state name of the pin configuration. Only
				support: "default".
- pinctrl-0:			The phandles of the pin configuration node in
				pinctrl for smb_int_pin and usb-id pin.

				the battery is charged. Supported range 3460V to 4360V
- qcom,charging-timeout		Maximum duration in minutes that a single charge
				cycle may last.  Supported values are: 0, 192, 384,
				768, and 1536.  A value of 0 means that no
				charge cycle timeout is used and charging can
				continue indefinitely.

				by default. Useful in usecases where battery current
				needs to be profiled even when USB is present.
- qcom,recharge-thresh-mv	Specifies the minimum voltage drop in millivolts
				below the float voltage that is required in
				order to initiate a new charging cycle.
