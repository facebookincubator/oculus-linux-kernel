Qualcomm QPNP Linear Charger

The charger module supports the linear battery charger peripherals on
Qualcomm PMIC chips.

There are four different peripherals in the charger module.
Each of these peripherals are implemented as subnodes.

- qcom,chgr:		Supports charging control and status reporting
- qcom,bat-if:		Battery status reporting such as presence and
			temperature reporting.
- qcom,usb-chgpth:	USB charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,chg-misc:	Miscellaneous features such as comparator override
			features etc.

Parent node required properties:
- qcom,vddmax-mv:			Target voltage of battery in mV.
- qcom,vddsafe-mv:			Maximum Vdd voltage in mV.
- qcom,vinmin-mv:			Minimum input voltage in mV.
- qcom,ibatsafe-ma:			Safety battery current setting

Parent node optional properties:
- qcom,vbatweak-uv:			Weak battery voltage threshold in uV,
					above which fast charging can start.
					The supported voltage range is from
					3000000uV to 3581250uV with a step
					size of 18750000 uV.
- qcom,charging-disabled:		Set this property to disable charging
					by default.
- qcom,use-default-batt-values:		Set this flag to force reporting of
					fake battery.
- qcom,warm-bat-decidegc:		Warm battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,cool-bat-decidegc:		Cool battery temperature in decidegC.
					Note that if both warm and cool
					battery temperatures are set, the
					corresponding ibatmax and bat-mv
					properties are required to be set.
- qcom,ibatmax-cool-ma:			Maximum cool battery charge current.
- qcom,ibatmax-warm-ma:			Maximum warm battery charge current.
- qcom,warm-bat-mv:			Warm temperature battery target
					voltage.
- qcom,cool-bat-mv:			Cool temperature battery target
					voltage.
- qcom,thermal-mitigation:		Array of ibatmax values for different
					system thermal mitigation level.
- qcom,tchg-mins:			Maximum total software initialized
					charge time.
- qcom,bpd-detection:			Select a battery presence detection
					scheme by specifying either "bpd_thm"
					"bpd_id" or "bpd_thm_id". "bpd_thm"
					selects the temperature pin, "bpd_id"
					uses the id pin for battery presence
					detection, "bpd_thm_id" selects both.
					If the property is not set, the
					temperatue pin will be used.
- qcom,btc-disabled:			If flag is set battery hot and cold
					monitoring is disabled in hardware.
					This monitoring is turned on by
					default.
- qcom,batt-hot-percentage:		Specify a supported hot threshold
					percentage.
					Supported thresholds: 25% and 35%. If
					none is specified hardware defaults
					will be used.
- qcom,batt-cold-percentage:		Specify a supported cold threshold
					percentage. Supported thresholds: 70%
					and 80%. If none is specified
					hardwaredefaults will be used.
- qcom,chg-adc_tm                       Corresponding ADC TM device's phandle
					to set recurring measurements and
					receive notification for batt_therm.
-qcom,float-charge			If specified enable float charging.
- qcom,chg-vadc				Corresponding VADC device's phandle.
- qcom,charger-detect-eoc		If specified charger hardware will
					detect end-of-charge.
					If not specified charger driver
					depends on BMSfor end-of-charge
					detection.
- qcom,disable-vbatdet-based-recharge   If specified disable VBATDET irq
					and charging can only be resumed
					if charger is re-inserted or SOC
					falls below resume SOC.
					This property should always be used
					along with the BMS property:
					"qcom,disable-suspend-on-usb".
- qcom,use-external-charger		If specified the LBC module will
					be disabled and the driver will not
					register. It also enables BID for
					BPD and disables BTC. Declare this node
					only if you are using an external charger
					and not the PMIC internal LBC.
- qcom,chgr-led-support			There is a current sink device in linear
					charger module, it is used to control a
					led which can act as a charger led as well
					as a general notification led.
- qcom,parallel-charger			This is a bool property to indicate the
					LBC will operate as a secondary charger
					in the parallel mode. If this is enabled
					the charging operations will be controlled by
					the primary-charger.
- qcom,collapsible-chgr-support		If specified the collapsible charger feature
					will be supported. LBC will disable VIN_MIN
					comparator and use chg_gone interrupt to
					detect charger removal.


Sub node required structure:
- A qcom,charger node must be a child of an SPMI node that has specified
	the spmi-dev-container property. Each subnode reflects
	a hardware peripheral which adds a unique set of features
	to the collective charging device. For example USB detection
	and the battery interface are each separate peripherals and
	each should be their own subnode.

Sub node required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,qpnp-linear-charger".
- reg:			Specifies the SPMI address and size for this
			peripheral.
- interrupts:		Specifies the interrupt associated with the
			peripheral.
- interrupt-names:	Specifies the interrupt names for the peripheral.
			Every available interrupt needs to have an associated
			name with it to indentify its purpose.

			The following lists each subnode and their
			corresponding required interrupt names:

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid

			The following interrupts are available:

			qcom,usb-chgpth:
			 - usbin-valid:		Indicates valid USB
						connection.
			 - coarse-det-usb:	Coarse detect interrupt
						triggers at low voltage on
						USB_IN.
			 - chg-gone:		Triggers on VCHG line.
			 - overtemp:		Triggers on over temperature
						condition

			 qcom,chgr:
			 - chg-done:		Triggers on charge completion.
			 - chg-failed:		Notifies of charge failures.
			 - fast-chg-on:		Notifies of fast charging.
			 - vbat-det-lo:		Triggers on vbat-det-lo
						voltage.
