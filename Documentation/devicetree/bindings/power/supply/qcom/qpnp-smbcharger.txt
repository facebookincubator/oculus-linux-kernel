QPNP SMB Battery Charger

QPNP SMB Charger is a single-cell switching mode battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB and AC adapter input.

The QPNP SMB Charger interfaces via the SPMI bus.

There are six different peripherals adding the following functionality.
Each of these peripherals are implemented as subnodes in the example at the
end of this file.

- qcom,chgr:		Supports charging control and status
			reporting.
- qcom,bat-if:		Battery status reporting such as presence,
			temperature reporting and voltage collapse
			protection.
- qcom,usb-chgpth:	USB charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,dc-chgpth:	DC charge path detection and input current
			limiting configuration.
- qcom,chg-misc:	Miscellaneous features such as watchdog timers
			and SYSOK pin control
- qcom,chg-otg:		OTG configuration control.

				the charger boost for OTG operation.
- qcom,smbcharger-external-otg	A subnode for a regulator device that switches

Regulator Sub node required properties:
- regulator-name		A name string for the regulator in question

				precharge cycle may last.  Supported values
				are: 0, 24, 48, 96, 192.  A value of 0 means

- qcom,wipower-pt-ilim-map
- qcom,wipower-default-ilim-map
				Array of 5 elements to indicate the voltage ranges and their corresponding
				current limits. The 5 elements with index [0..4] are:
				[0] => voltage_low in uV
				[1] => voltage_high in uV
				[2] => current limit for pass through in mA
				[3] => current limit for div2 mode dcin low voltage in mA
				[4] => current limit for div2 mode dcin high voltage in mA
				The div2 and pt tables indicate the current limits
				to use when Wipower is operating in divide_by_2 mode
				and pass through mode respectively.
				The default table is used when the voltage ranges
				are beyond the ones specified in the mapping table.
				Note that if dcin-vadc or any of these mapping
				tables are not specified, dynamic dcin input
				is disabled.
- qcom,charging-disabled	Set this if charging should be disabled in the
				build by default.
- qcom,resume-delta-mv		Specifies the minimum voltage drop in
				millivolts below the float voltage that is
				required in order to initiate a new charging
				cycle. Supported values are: 50, 100, 200 and
				300mV.
- qcom,chg-inhibit-en		Boolean that indicates whether the charge inhibit
				feature needs to be enabled. If this is not set,
				charge inhibit feature is disabled by default.

				to be Fuel gauge ADC. If this is not set, it
				will be analog sensor by default.
- qcom,bmd-algo-disabled	Indicates if the battery missing detection
				algorithm is disabled. If this node is present
				SMB uses the THERM pin for battery missing
				detection.
- qcom,charge-unknown-battery	Boolean that indicates whether an unknown
				battery without a matching profile will be
				charged. If this is not set, if the fuel gauge
				does not recognize the battery based on its
				battery ID, the charger will not start
				charging.
- qcom,bmd-pin-src		A string that indicates the source pin for the
				battery missind detection. This can be either:
				- "bpd_none"
					battery is considered always present
				- "bpd_id"
					battery id pin is used
				- "bpd_thm"
					battery therm pin is used
				- "bpd_thm_id"
					both pins are used (battery is
					considered missing if either pin is
					floating).
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate
				end-of-charge. Possible values in mA:
				50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 500, 600.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This
				is a boolean property.
- otg-parent-supply		A phandle to an external boost regulator for
				OTG if it exists.

				the line from the battery connectors through
				vph_power. This is used to calculate maximum
				available current of the battery.

				This is used to calculate maximum available
				current of the battery.
- qcom,autoadjust-vfloat	A boolean property that when set, makes the
				driver automatically readjust vfloat using the
				fuel gauge ADC readings to make charging more
				accurate.
- qcom,jeita-temp-hard-limit	property when present will enable or disable
				the jeita temperature hard limit based on the
				value 1 or 0. Specify 0 if the jeita temp hard
				limit needs to be disabled. If it is not present,
				jeita temperature hard limit will be based on what
				the bootloader had set earlier.
- qcom,low-volt-dcin:		A boolean property which upon set will enable the
				AICL deglitch configuration dynamically. This needs
				to be set if the DCIN supply is going to be less
				than or equal to 5V.
- qcom,force-aicl-rerun:	A boolean property which upon set will enable the
				AICL rerun by default along with the deglitch time
				configured to long interval (20 ms). Also, specifying
				this property will not adjust the AICL deglitch time
				dynamically for handling the battery over-voltage
				oscillations when the charger is headroom limited.
- qcom,aicl-rerun-period-s	If force-aicl-rerun is on, this property dictates
				how often aicl is reran in seconds. Possible values

- qcom,ibat-ocp-threshold-ua	Maximum current before the battery will trigger
				overcurrent protection. Use the recommended
				battery pack value minus some margin.

					powered via external source and could
					go above the float voltage.

					charger before enabling the parallel
					charger if one exists. Do not define
					this property if no parallel chargers
					exist.

					charger before enabling the parallel
					charger if one exists. This property
					applies only for 9V chargers.
- qcom,parallel-allowed-lowering-ma	Acceptable current drop from the initial limit
					to keep parallel charger activated. If the
					charger current reduces beyond this threshold
					parallel charger is disabled. Must be specified
					if parallel charger is used.
- qcom,parallel-main-chg-fcc-percent	Percentage of the fast charge current allotted to the
					main charger when parallel charging is enabled and
					operational. If this property is not defined, the
					driver defaults to a 50%/50% split between the main
					and parallel charger.
- qcom,parallel-main-chg-icl-percent	Percentage of the input current allotted to the
					main charger when parallel charging is enabled and
					operational. If this property is not defined, the

					contains the battery-profiles supported
					by the charger/FG.
