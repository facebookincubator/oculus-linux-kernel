Summit smb1351 battery charger

SMB1351 is a single-cell battery charger. It can charge
the battery and power the system via the USB/AC adapter input.

The smb1351 interface is via I2C bus.

Required Properties:
- compatible			Must be "qcom,smb1351-charger".
- reg				The device 7-bit I2C address.

Required Properties for standalone charger:
- regulator-name		A string used as a descriptive name for OTG regulator.
- pinctrl-names			The state name of the pin configuration. Only
				support "default".
- pinctrl-0			The phandle of the pin configuration node in
				pinctrl for smb_int_pin.

Optional Properties:

- interrupts			This indicates the IRQ number of the GPIO
				connected to the STAT pin.
- qcom,fastchg-current-max-ma 	Fast Charging current in mA. Supported range is
				from 1000mA to 4500mA.
- qcom,chg-autonomous-mode	This is a bool property and it indicates that the
				charger is configured for autonomous operation and
				does not require any software configuration.
- qcom,disable-apsd		This is a bool property which disables automatic
				power source detection (APSD). If this is set
				charger detection is done by DCIN UV irq.
- qcom,charging-disabled	This is a bool property which disables charging.
- qcom,using-pmic-therm		This property indicates thermal pin connected to pmic or smb.
- qcom,bms-psy-name		This is a string and it points to the bms
				power supply name.
- qcom,iterm-ma			Specifies the termination current to indicate end-of-charge.
				Possible values in mA - 70, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700.
- qcom,iterm-disabled		Disables the termination current feature. This is a bool
				property.
- qcom,float-voltage-mv	 	Float Voltage in mV - the maximum voltage up to which
				the battery is charged. Supported range 3500mV to 4500mV
- qcom,recharge-mv		Recharge threshold in mV - the offset from the float-volatge
				as which the charger restarts charging. Possible
				values are 50mV and 100mV.
- qcom,recharge-disabled	Boolean value which disables the auto-recharge.
- qcom,bms-controlled-charging	This property enables BMS to control EOC and
				recharge. BMS and charger communicates with each
				other via power_supply framework. This
				property should be used with 'qcom,iterm-disabled'
				to ensure EOC detection in charger is disabled.
- qcom,force-hvdcp-2p0		Boolean value which allows to force hvdcp working on 2.0 mode.
- qcom,parallel-charger		Boolean value which enables the parallel charger.
- qcom,chg-vadc			Corresponding VADC device's phandle.
- qcom,chg-adc_tm		phandle to the corresponding VADC device to read the ADC channels.
- qcom,batt-cold-decidegc	Cold battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,batt-hot-decidegc	Hot battery temperature in decidegC.
- qcom,batt-missing-decidegc	This is a property indicating battery missing temperature, if
				higher than it, battery should exist.
- qcom,batt-warm-decidegc:	Warm battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,warm-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,warm-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,batt-cool-decidegc:       Cool battery temperature in decidegC. After hitting this threshold,
				"qcom,cool-bat-ma" defines maximum charging current and
				"qcom,cool-bat-mv" defines maximum target voltage.
- qcom,batt-warm-ma:		Maximum warm battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,batt-cool-ma:		Maximum cool battery charge current in milli-amps.
- qcom,batt-warm-mv:		Maximum warm battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,batt-cool-mv:		Maximum cool battery target voltage in milli-volts.
- qcom,parallel-en-pin-polarity Specify the polarity of enable signal controlled
				via pin in a parallel-charger configuration.
				0 - Active low and 1  - Active high.
				If not specified the default value is active-low.
- qcom,parallel-external-current-sense If present specifies external rsense is
				used for charge current sensing.
- qcom,stacked-batfet:		Boolean flag. Specifies if parallel charger has stacked BATFET
				cofiguration.
