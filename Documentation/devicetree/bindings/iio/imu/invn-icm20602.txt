The ICM20602 sensor is 6-axis gyroscope+accelerometer combo
device which is made by InvenSense Inc.

Required properties:

 - compatible	: Should be "invensense,icm20602".
 - reg	: the I2C address which depends on the AD0 pin.
 - interrupt-parent	: should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
 - interrupts	: interrupt mapping for GPIO IRQ

Optional properties:
 - invensense,icm20602-gpio:  the irq gpio. This is not used if
 using SMD to trigger. this is needed only if using the
 device IRQ to trigger. Only using SMD to trigger can
 support 8K sample rate.

Example:
	icm20602-i2c@068 {
		compatible = "invensense,icm20602";
		reg = <0x68>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
		interrupts = <13 0>;
		invensense,icm20602-gpio = <&msm_gpio 13 0x0>;
		pinctrl-names = "imu_active","imu_suspend";
		pinctrl-0 = <&imu_int_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&imu_int_suspend>;
		status = "okay";
	};
