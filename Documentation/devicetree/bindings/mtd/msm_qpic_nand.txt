Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Parallel Interface controller (QPIC) for NAND devices

Required properties:
- compatible : "qcom,msm-nand".
- reg : should specify QPIC NANDc and BAM physical address range.
- reg-names : should specify relevant names to each reg property defined.
- interrupts : should specify QPIC/BAM interrupt numbers.
- interrupt-names : should specify relevant names to each interrupts property
  defined.
- qcom,reg-adjustment-offset : Specify the base adjustment offset value for the
  version registers
- qcom,qpic-clk-rpmh: Indicates whether QPIC clock is RPMH controlled clock or
  not.

MTD flash partition layout for NAND devices -

Each partition is represented as a sub-node of the qcom,mtd-partitions device.
Each node's name represents the name of the corresponding partition.

This is now completely optional as the partition information is avaialble from
bootloader.

Optional properties:
- reg : boot_cfg. This is needed only on the targets where both NAND and eMMC
  devices are supported. On eMMC based builds, NAND cannot be enabled by
  default due to the absence of some of its required resources.
- reg : The partition offset and size
- label : The label / name for this partition.
- read-only: This parameter, if present, indicates that this partition
  should only be mounted read-only.
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
below optional properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
	- qcom,msm-bus,active-only
	- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
	- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps

		compatible = "qcom,msm-nand";
		reg = <0xf9af0000 0x1000>,
