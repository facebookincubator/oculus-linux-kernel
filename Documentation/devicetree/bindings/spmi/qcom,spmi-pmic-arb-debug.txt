Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SPMI Debug Controller (PMIC Arbiter)

The SPMI PMIC Arbiter is found on various QTI chips.  It is an SPMI controller
with wrapping arbitration logic to allow for multiple on-chip devices to control
a single SPMI master.

The PMIC Arbiter debug bus is present starting at arbiter version 5.  It has
read and write access to all PMIC peripherals regardless of ownership
configurations.  It cannot be used on production devices because it is disabled
by an eFuse.

See spmi.txt for the generic SPMI controller binding requirements for child
nodes.

Supported Properties:

- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must be "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb-debug".

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: List of address and size pairs.  The address of the PMIC
		    arbiter module is required.  The address of the debug bus
		    disabling fuse is optional.

- reg-names
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <stringlist>
	Definition: Address names. Must include "core" for the PMIC arbiter
		    module and may include "fuse" for the debug bus disabling
		    fuse.  The strings must be specified in the same order as
		    the corresponding addresses are specified in the reg
		    property.

- clocks
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Clock tuple consisting of a phandle to a clock controller
		    device and the clock ID number for the SPMI debug controller
		    clock.

- clock-names
	Usage:      required if clocks property is specified
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Defines the name of the clock defined in the "clocks"
		    property.  This must be "core_clk".

- #address-cells
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Must be 2.

- #size-cells
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Must be 0.

- qcom,fuse-disable-bit
	Usage:      required if "fuse" is listed in reg-names property
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The bit within the fuse register which is set when the debug
		    bus is not available.  Supported values are 0 to 31.

Example:

qcom,spmi-debug@6b22000 {
	compatible = "qcom,spmi-pmic-arb-debug";
	reg = <0x6b22000 0x60>, <0x7820A8 4>;
	reg-names = "core", "fuse";
	clocks = <&clock_aop QDSS_CLK>;
	clock-names = "core_clk";
	qcom,fuse-disable-bit = <12>;
	#address-cells = <2>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
};
