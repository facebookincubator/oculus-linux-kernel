wsa881x Audio CODEC

wsa881x Audio CODEC can support either I2C interface or Soundwire interface.
In Analog mode, this codec will operate as I2C slave device and
interacts with I2C controller for status, control and interrupt management.
The wsa881x device nodes will be represented as child nodes to I2C
master device node in the devicetree. Currently, the below devicetree
bindings are for I2C mode only and does not include soundwire mode.

Required properties:

 - compatible : "qcom,wsa881x-i2c-codec"
 - reg : Unique device ID of I2C slave device.

Optional properties:
- qcom,msm-gpios : Lists down all the gpio sets that are supported.
- qcom,pinctrl-names : Lists all the possible combinations of the gpio sets
mentioned in qcom,msm-gpios. Say we have 2^N combinations for N GPIOs, this
list all 2^N combinations.
- pinctrl-names : The combinations of gpio sets from above that are supported in
the flavor. This can be sometimes same as qcom, pinctrl-names i.e with 2^N
combinations or will have less incase if some combination is not supported.
- pinctrl-# : Pinctrl states as mentioned in pinctrl-names.

Required properties:

 - compatible :                            "qcom,wsa-irq"
 - interrupt-controller :                  Mark this device node as an
					   interrupt controller
 - #interrupt-cells :                      Should be 1
 - interrupt-parent :                      Parent interrupt controller
 - interrupts :                            Interrupt number on the parent
                                           interrupt controller
 - interrupt-names :                       Name of interrupt on the parent
                                           interrupt controller
