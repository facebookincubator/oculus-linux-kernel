wsa881x Audio CODEC

wsa881x Audio CODEC can support either Soundwire interface or I2C interface.
In Soundwire mode, this codec will operate as soundwire slave device and
uses soundwire framework to interact with soundwire master controller.
The wsa881x device nodes will be represented as child nodes to soundwire
master device node in the devicetree. Currently, the below devicetree
bindings are for soundwire mode only and does not include I2C mode.

Required properties:

 - compatible : "qcom,wsa881x"
 - reg : Unique device ID of soundwire slave device(48 bits).
 - qcom,spkr-sd-n-gpio : shutdown gpio pin to keep wsa881x in low power mode.
 - pinctrl-names : Pincntrl entries to configure the PDM gpio lines and
		  cross connection switch gpio accordingly
 - pinctrl-0 : This explains the active state of the shutdown gpio pin
          to keep wsa881x in low power mode
 - pinctrl-1 : This explains the suspend state of the shutdown gpio pin
          to keep wsa881x in low power mode

Optional properties:

Example:

wsa881x@32000 {
	compatible = "qcom,wsa881x";
	reg = <0x00 0x032000>;
	qcom,spkr-sd-n-gpio = <&pmi8994_gpios 2 0>;
	pinctrl-names = "wsa_spkr_sd_act",
		"wsa_spkr_sd_sus";
	pinctrl-0 = <&wsa_spkr_sd_act>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&wsa_spkr_sd_sus>;
};

wsa881x@42000 {
	compatible = "qcom,wsa881x";
	reg = <0x00 0x042000>;
	qcom,spkr-sd-n-gpio = <&pmi8994_gpios 3 0>;
	pinctrl-names = "wsa_spkr_sd_act",
		"wsa_spkr_sd_sus";
	pinctrl-0 = <&wsa_spkr_sd_act>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&wsa_spkr_sd_sus>;

};
