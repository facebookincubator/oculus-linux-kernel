Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. FastRPC MDSP CMA Heap

The MSM MDSPRPC memory device allocates CMA memory, for sharing memory
of FastRPC buffers to remote processor(MDSP).

Required properties:
-compatible: Must be "qcom,msm-mdsprpc-mem-region"
-memory-region: A phandle that points to a memory heap where the
heap memory is allocated

Example:
	qcom,mdsprpc-mem {
		compatible = "qcom,msm-mdsprpc-mem-region";
		memory-region = <&mdsp_mem>;
	};

Ion Heap:

Ion heap allows for sharing of buffers between different processors
and between user space and kernel space.
(see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_ion.txt).

Required properties for Ion heap:
- compatible : "qcom,msm-ion"
