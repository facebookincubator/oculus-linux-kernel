Qualcomm QPNP power-on

The qpnp-power-on is a driver which supports the power-on(PON)
peripheral on Qualcomm PMICs. The supported functionality includes
power on/off reason, key press/release detection, PMIC reset configurations
and other PON specific features. The PON module supports multiple physical
power-on (KPDPWR_N, CBLPWR) and reset (KPDPWR_N, RESIN, KPDPWR+RESIN) sources.
This peripheral is connected to the host processor via the SPMI interface.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Must be "qcom,qpnp-power-on"
- reg:		Specifies the SPMI address and size for this PON (power-on)
		peripheral.
- interrupts:	Specifies the interrupt associated with PON.
- interrupt-names:	Specify the interrupt names associated with interrupts.
			Must be one of "kpdpwr", "kpdpwr-bark", "resin",
			"resin-bark", "cblpwr", "kpdpwr-resin-bark".Bark
			interrupts are associated with system reset
			configuration to allow default reset configuration to
			be activated. If system reset configuration is not
			supported then bark interrupts are nops. Additionally,
			the "pmic-wd-bark" interrupt can be added if the system
			needs to handle PMIC watch dog barks.

Optional properties:
- qcom,pon-dbc-delay		The debounce delay for the power-key interrupt
				specified in us.
				Possible values for GEN1 PON are:
				15625, 31250, 62500, 125000, 250000, 500000,
				1000000 and 2000000.
				Possible values for GEN2 PON are:
				62, 123, 245, 489, 977, 1954, 3907, 7813,
				15625, 31250, 62500, 125000 and 250000.
				Intermediate value is rounded down to the
				nearest valid value.
- qcom,pon_1 ...pon_n		These represent the child nodes which describe
				the properties (reset, key) for each of the pon
				reset source. All the child nodes are optional.
				If none of them is specified, the driver fails
				to register.
- qcom,system-reset		Specifies that this PON peripheral can be used
				to reset the system. This property can only be
				used by one device on the system. It is an
				error to include it more than once.
- qcom,s3-debounce		The debounce delay for stage3 reset trigger in
				secs. The values range from 0 to 128.
- qcom,s3-src			The source for stage 3 reset. It can be one of
				"kpdpwr", "resin", "kpdpwr-or-resin" or
				"kpdpwr-and-resin". The default value is
				"kpdpwr-and-resin".
- qcom,uvlo-panic		If this property is present, the device will
				set to panic during reboot if this reboot is
				due to under voltage lock out.
- qcom,clear-warm-reset		Specifies that the WARM_RESET reason registers
				need to be cleared for this target. The
				property is used for the targets which have a
				hardware feature to catch resets which aren't
				triggered by the MSM.
				In such cases clearing WARM_REASON registers
				across MSM resets keeps the registers in good
				state.
- qcom,secondary-pon-reset	Boolean property which indicates that the PON
				peripheral is a secondary PON device which
				needs to be configured during reset in addition
				to the primary PON device that is configured
				for system reset through qcom,system-reset
				property.
				This should not be defined along with the
				qcom,system-reset property.
- qcom,store-hard-reset-reason	Boolean property which if set will store the
				hardware reset reason to SOFT_RB_SPARE register
				of the core PMIC PON peripheral.
- qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-type	Poweroff type required to be configured on
				PS_HOLD reset control register when the system
				goes for warm reset. If this property is not
				specified, then the default type, warm reset
				will be configured to PS_HOLD reset control
				register.
- qcom,hard-reset-poweroff-type	Same description as qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-
				type but this applies for the system hard reset
				case.
- qcom,shutdown-poweroff-type	Same description as qcom,warm-reset-poweroff-
				type but this applies for the system shutdown
				case.
- qcom,kpdpwr-sw-debounce	Boolean property to enable the debounce logic
				on the KPDPWR_N rising edge.
- qcom,resin-pon-reset		Boolean property which indicates that resin
				needs to be configured during reset in addition
				to the primary PON device that is configured
				for system reset through qcom,system-reset
				property.
- qcom,resin-warm-reset-type 	Poweroff type required to be configured on
				RESIN reset control register when the system
				goes for warm reset. If this property is not
				specified, then the default type, warm reset
				will be configured to RESIN reset control
				register. This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
- qcom,resin-hard-reset-type 	Same description as qcom,resin-warm-reset-type
				but this applies for the system hard reset case.
- qcom,resin-shutdown-type   	Same description as qcom,resin-warm-reset-type
				but this applies for the system shutdown case.
- qcom,resin-shutdown-disable	Boolean property to disable RESIN POFF
				trigger during system shutdown case.
				This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
- qcom,resin-hard-reset-disable	Boolean property to disable RESIN POFF
	                        trigger during system hard reset case.
				This property is effective only if
				qcom,resin-pon-reset is defined.
- qcom,ps-hold-shutdown-disable	Boolean property to disable PS_HOLD POFF
				trigger during system shutdown case.
- qcom,ps-hold-hard-reset-disable	Boolean property to disable PS_HOLD
				POFF trigger during system hard reset case.
- qcom,use-legacy-hard-reset-offset	Boolean property to support legacy
				hard-reset offset of the PON_RB_SPARE register for
				some (PON gen2) platforms.
- qcom,support-twm-config       Boolean property to allow the PON module to be
                                configured to support TWM modes.
- qcom,pbs-client               Phandle of the PBS client node. Should be
                                defined if 'qcom,support-twm-config' is present.

All the below properties are in the sub-node section (properties of the child
node).

Sub-nodes (if defined) should belong to either a PON configuration or a
regulator configuration.

Regulator sub-node required properties:
- regulator-name		Regulator name for the PON regulator that
				is being configured.
- qcom,pon-spare-reg-addr	Register offset from the base address of the
				PON peripheral that needs to be configured for
				the regulator being controlled.
- qcom,pon-spare-reg-bit	Bit position in the specified register that
				needs to be configured for the regulator being
				controlled.

PON sub-node required properties:

				currently supports KPDPWR(0), RESIN(1) and
				CBLPWR(2) pon/reset sources.

PON sub-node optional properties:

				consideration.
				0 = No pull-up
				1 = pull-up enabled
				This property is set to '0' if not specified.
- qcom,support-reset		Indicates if this PON source supports
				reset functionality.
				0 = Not supported
				1 = Supported
				If this property is not defined, then do not
				modify S2 reset values.

				irq.
- linux,code                    The input key-code associated with the reset
				source.
                                The reset source in its default configuration
				can be used to support standard keys.

The below mentioned properties are required only when qcom,support-reset DT
property is defined and is set to 1.
