STM VL53L0X Time-of-Flight ranging and gesture detection sensor driver

Description:

The VL53L0X is a new generation Time-of-Flight
(ToF) laser-ranging module housed in the
smallest package on the market today, providing
accurate distance measurement whatever the
target reflectances unlike conventional
technologies. It can measure absolute distances
up to 2m, setting a new benchmark in ranging
performance levels, opening the door to various
new applications.
The VL53L0X integrates a leading-edge SPAD
array (Single Photon Avalanche Diodes) and
embeds ST’s second generation FlightSenseTM
patented technology.
The VL53L0X’s 940 nm VCSEL emitter (Vertical
Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser), is totally invisible
to the human eye, coupled with internal physical
infrared filters, it enables longer ranging
distances, higher immunity to ambient light, and
better robustness to cover glass optical crosstalk.

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "st,stmvl53l0".
 - reg			: i2c slave address of the device.

Example:
	i2c@f9925000 {
		vl53l0x@52 {
			compatible = "st,stmvl53l0";
			reg = <0x52>;
		};
	};
