* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM Camera SOC

The below set of properties need to be defined by all the camera
modules in their respective dtsi to adapt to SOC layer

Required properties:
  - clock-names: name of the clocks required for the device
  - qcom,clock-rates: clock rate in Hz
    - 0 if appropriate clock is required but doesn't have to apply the rate
  - qcom,vdd-names: names of all the regulators for the device
  - Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
    below optional properties:
      - qcom,msm-bus,name
      - qcom,msm-bus,num-cases
      - qcom,msm-bus,num-paths
      - qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps
  - qcom,msm-bus-vector-dyn-vote: indicated dynamic or static voting
  - qcom,clock-cntl-support: indicates if further control supported for clocks
  - Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video/msm-ispif.txt" for
    below optional property:
      - qcom,clock-control

Example:

   cpp: qcom,cpp@a04000 {
       mmagic-vdd-supply = <&gdsc_mmagic_camss>;
       camss-vdd-supply = <&gdsc_camss_top>;
       vdd-supply = <&gdsc_cpp>;
       qcom,vdd-names = "mmagic-vdd", "camss-vdd", "vdd";
       clock-names = "camss_top_ahb_clk",
                "ispif_ahb_clk", "csiphy_timer_src_clk",
                "csiphy_timer_clk";
       qcom,clock-rates = <0 0 200000000 0>;
       qcom,msm-bus,name = "msm_camera_cpp";
       qcom,msm-bus,num-cases = <2>;
       qcom,msm-bus,num-paths = <1>;
       qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps =
               <106 512 0 0>,
               <106 512 0 0>;
       qcom,msm-bus-vector-dyn-vote;
   };
