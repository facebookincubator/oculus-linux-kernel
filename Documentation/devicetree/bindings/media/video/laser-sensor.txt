Laser Sensor Device Tree Bindings.
========================================

Boards with the Laser Sensor connected to CCI shall have the following
properties:

Required node properties:
	- cell-index: cci hardware core index
    - compatible:
		- "st,stmvl53l0" : STMiecroelectronics VL53L0 Laser sensor.
	- reg : offset and length of the register set for the device
	- qcom, cci-master: cci master the sensor connected to
	- cam_cci-supply : cci voltage regulator used
	- cam_laser-supply: laser sensor voltage regulator
	- qcom,cam-vreg-name: voltage regulators name
	- qcom, cam-vreg-min-voltage: specify minimum voltage level for
		regulators used
	- qcom, cam-vreg-max-voltage: specify maximum voltage level for
		regulators used
	- pinctrl-names : should specify the pin control groups followed by
		the definition of each group
		stm,irq-gpio : irq gpio which is to provide interrupts to host.
	- gpios : should contain phandle to gpio controller node and array of
		#gpio-cells specifying specific gpio (controller specific)
	- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num : contains index to gpios specific to the sensor
	- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-flags : should contain direction of gpios present in
		qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property (in the same order)
	- qcom,gpio-req-tbl-label : should contain name of gpios present in
		qcom,gpio-req-tbl-num property (in the same order)
