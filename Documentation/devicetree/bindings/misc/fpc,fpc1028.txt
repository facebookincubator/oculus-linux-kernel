Fingerprint Cards AB. Fpc1028 driver

The fpc1028 fingerprint sensor is connected to the host processor via SPI.
The sensor will generates interrupts when the user touches the sensor.
The host controller is expected to read data over SPI and pass the data to
the rest of the system.

This binding document describes the properties for this module.

Properties:

- compatible
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: It must be "fpc,fpc1020"

- interrupts
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Peripheral interrupt specifier.

- interrupt-parent
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: phandle of the interrupt controller which services the
  summary interrupt.

- fpc,gpio_rst
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: GPIO which connecting to the reset pin of fpc1028

- fpc,gpio_irq
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
  Definition: Specifies the GPIO which connecting to the irq pin of fpc1028.

- vcc_spi-supply
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: The phandle of the regulator which supplies fpc1028 spi bus core.

- vcc_io-supply
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: The phandle of the regulator which supplies fpc1028 io pins.

- vcc_ana-supply
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <phandle>
  Definition: The phandle of the regulator which supplies fpc1028 analog circuit.

- pinctrl-names:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: Pinctrl state names for each pin group configuration.
  eg:"fpc1020_reset_reset", "fpc1020_reset_active", "fpc1020_irq_active".
  refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt"

- pinctrl-n:
  Usage:      required
  Value type: <string>
  Definition: pinctrl state for each pin group
  refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt"


Example:

	fpc1020 {
			compatible = "fpc,fpc1020";
			interrupt-parent = <&tlmm>;
			interrupts = <48 0>;
			fpc,gpio_rst = <&tlmm 124 0x0>;
			fpc,gpio_irq = <&tlmm 48 0>;
			vcc_spi-supply = <&pm8953_l5>;
			vdd_io-supply  = <&pm8953_l5>;
			vdd_ana-supply = <&pm8953_l5>;
			fpc,enable-on-boot;
			pinctrl-names = "fpc1020_reset_reset",
					"fpc1020_reset_active",
					"fpc1020_irq_active";
			pinctrl-0 = <&msm_gpio_124>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&msm_gpio_124_output_high>;
			pinctrl-2 = <&msm_gpio_48>;
		};
