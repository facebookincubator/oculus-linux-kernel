msm_sharedmem provides the shared memory addresses for various clients in user-space

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "qcom,sharedmem-uio"
- reg : The address and size of the shared memory. The address/sizes may vary.
	A reg address of Zero indicates that the shared memory is dynamically
	allocated using dma_alloc_coherent. A non zero reg address is used
	directly.
- reg-names : Indicates various client-names.
- qcom,client-id : The client id for the QMI clients.

Optional properties:
- qcom,guard-memory:	If this dtsi property is set, then the shared memory
			region will be guarded by SZ_4K at the start and at the end.
			This is needed to overcome the XPU limitation on few MSM HW,
			so as to make this memory not contiguous with other allocations
			that may possibly happen from other clients.

Example:
	qcom,msm_sharedmem@0dc80000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sharedmem-uio";
		reg = <0x0dc80000 0x00180000>,
		reg-names = "rmtfs";
		qcom,client-id = <0x00000001>;
		qcom,guard-memory;
	};
