GENI based Qualcomm Technologies Inc Universal Peripheral version 3 (QUPv3)
								I2C controller

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be:
   * "qcom,i2c-geni.
 - reg: Should contain QUP register address and length.
 - interrupts: Should contain I2C interrupt.
 - clocks: Serial engine core clock, and AHB clocks needed by the device.
 - pinctrl-names/pinctrl-0/1: The GPIOs assigned to this core. The names
   should be "active" and "sleep" for the pin confuguration when core is active
   or when entering sleep state.
 - #address-cells: Should be <1> Address cells for i2c device address
 - #size-cells: Should be <0> as i2c addresses have no size component
 - qcom,wrapper-core: Wrapper QUPv3 core containing this I2C controller.

Optional property:
 - qcom,clk-freq-out : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
   When missing default to 400000Hz.
 - qcom,disable-autosuspend : Disable autosuspend for I2C controller and
   I2C clients should call pm_runtime_get_sync()/put_sync() for the
   I2C controller.

Child nodes should conform to i2c bus binding.

Example:

i2c@a94000 {
	compatible = "qcom,i2c-geni";
	reg = <0xa94000 0x4000>;
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 358 0>;
	clock-names = "se-clk", "m-ahb", "s-ahb";
	clocks = <&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP0_S5_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_M_AHB_CLK>,
		<&clock_gcc GCC_QUPV3_WRAP_0_S_AHB_CLK>;
	pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
	pinctrl-0 = <&qup_1_i2c_5_active>;
	pinctrl-1 = <&qup_1_i2c_5_sleep>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	qcom,wrapper-core = <&qupv3_0>;
	qcom,clk-freq-out = <400000>;
};
