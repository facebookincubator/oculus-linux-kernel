* CoreSight Components:

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight architecture
specification and can be connected in various topologies to suit a particular
SoCs tracing needs. These trace components can generally be classified as
sinks, links and sources. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows
through the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently selected
sink. Each CoreSight component device should use these properties to describe
its hardware characteristcs.

* Required properties for all components *except* non-configurable replicators:

	* compatible: These have to be supplemented with "arm,primecell" as
	  drivers are using the AMBA bus interface.  Possible values include:
		- Embedded Trace Buffer (version 1.0):
			"arm,coresight-etb10", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Port Interface Unit:
			"arm,coresight-tpiu", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Memory Controller, used for Embedded Trace Buffer(ETB),
		  Embedded Trace FIFO(ETF) and Embedded Trace Router(ETR)
		  configuration.  The configuration mode (ETB, ETF, ETR) is
		  discovered at boot time when the device is probed.
			"arm,coresight-tmc", "arm,primecell";

		- Trace Funnel:
			"arm,coresight-funnel", "arm,primecell";

		- Embedded Trace Macrocell (version 3.x) and
					Program Flow Trace Macrocell:
			"arm,coresight-etm3x", "arm,primecell";

		- Embedded Trace Macrocell (version 4.x):
			"arm,coresight-etm4x", "arm,primecell";

		- Qualcomm Configurable Replicator (version 1.x):
			"qcom,coresight-replicator1x", "arm,primecell";

		- System Trace Macrocell:
			"arm,coresight-stm", "arm,primecell"; [1]
		- Trigger Generation Unit:
			 "arm,primecell";

	* reg: physical base address and length of the register
	  set(s) of the component.

	* clocks: the clocks associated to this component.

	* clock-names: the name of the clocks referenced by the code.
	  Since we are using the AMBA framework, the name of the clock
	  providing the interconnect should be "apb_pclk", and some
	  coresight blocks also have an additional clock "atclk", which
	  clocks the core of that coresight component. The latter clock
	  is optional.

	  layout using the generic DT graph presentation found in
	  "bindings/graph.txt".

	  set as described above, another entry is required to describe the
	  mapping of the extended stimulus port area.

	  "stm-stimulus-base", each corresponding to the areas defined in "reg".

have the same HW interface and as such don't need an explicit binding name.
