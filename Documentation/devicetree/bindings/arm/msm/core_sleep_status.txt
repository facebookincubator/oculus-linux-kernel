* MSM Sleep status

MSM Sleep status device is used to check the power collapsed status of a
offlined core. The core that initiates the hotplug would wait on the
sleep status device before CPU_DEAD notifications are sent out. Some hardware
devices require that the offlined core is power collapsed before turning off
the resources that are used by the offlined core.

The required properties of core sleep status node are:
- compatible: qcom,cpu-sleep-status

The required properties of sleep status node are:
- reg: physical address of the sleep status register for the cpus
- qcom,cpu-sleep-status-mask - The bit mask within the status register that
	indicates the Core's sleep state.

Example:
	qcom,cpu-sleep-status {
		compatible = "qcom,cpu-sleep-status";
	};

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		CPU0: cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "qcom,kryo";

			qcom,sleep-status = <&cpu0_slp_sts>;
		};

		CPU1: cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			compatible = "qcom,kryo";

			qcom,sleep-status = <&cpu1_slp_sts>;
		};
	};

	cpu0_slp_sts: cpu-sleep-status@9981058 {
		reg = <0x9981058 0x100>;
		qcom,sleep-status-mask = <0xc00000>;
	};

	cpu1_slp_sts: cpu-sleep-status@9991058 {
		reg = <0x9991058 0x100>;
		qcom,sleep-status-mask = <0xc00000>;
	}
