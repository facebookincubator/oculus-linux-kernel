Command DB
---------

Command DB is a database that provides a mapping between resource key and
the resource address for a system resource managed by RPMh. The data is
stored in a shared memory region and is loaded by the remote processor.

Some of the "Qualcomm Technologies Inc" SOC's have hardware accelerators
for controlling shared resources.  The HW accelerator associated to a given
resource could change between builds when accelerators are added/removed.
To remove dependencies between multiple images in a SoC, Command DB allows
drivers to query resource parameters based on predetermined key strings.

The devicetree representation of the command DB driver should be:

PROPERTIES:
- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Should be "qcom,cmd-db"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: First element is the base address of shared memory
		Second element is the size of the shared memory region
		Points to the dictionary address that houses the command DB
		start address and the size of the command DB region

Example:

qcom,cmd-db@861e0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,cmd-db";
	reg = <0xc3f000c 0x8>;
}
