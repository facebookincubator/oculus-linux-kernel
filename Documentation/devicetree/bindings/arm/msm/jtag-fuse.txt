* JTAG-FUSE

The jtag-fuse entry specifies the memory mapped addresses for the fuse
registers. The jtag-fuse driver uses these to provide api(s) that can be used
by jtag save and restore driver(s) to query whether the Hardware they manage
is functionally disabled or not and take corresponding steps.

Required Properties:
compatible: component name used for driver matching, should be one of the
	following:
	"qcom,jtag-fuse" for jtag fuse device
	"qcom,jtag-fuse-v2" for jtag fuse v2 device
	"qcom,jtag-fuse-v3" for jtag fuse v3 device
reg: physical base address and length of the register set
reg-names: should be "fuse-base"

Example:
	jtag_fuse: jtagfuse@fc4be024 {
		compatible = "qcom,jtag-fuse";
		reg = <0xfc4be024 0x8>;
		reg-names = "fuse-base";
	};
