Msm Machine Name

Machine name is used to:
	1. show up in the beginning of kernel message.
	Example:
		[    0.000000] Machine: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM8953 PMI8950 MTP
	2. show up as arch description when do dump stack.
	Example:
		[    1.222319] WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 1 at kernel/lib/debugobjects.c:263 debug_print_object+0xa8/0xb0
		[    1.222334] Modules linked in:
		[    1.222362] CPU: 2 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.9.65+ #71
		[    1.222376] Hardware name: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM8953 PMI8950 MTP (DT)
		[    1.222392] task: ffffffc0ed1b0080 task.stack: ffffffc0ed1b8000
		[    1.222408] PC is at debug_print_object+0xa8/0xb0
		[    1.222424] LR is at debug_print_object+0xa8/0xb0

Msm machine name is a string concatenated from:
	1. constant string contain msm information: "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.".
	2. string of device tree property "qcom,msm-name".
	3. string of device tree property "qcom,pmic-name".
	4. string of device tree property "model".

The reason for using msm machine Name is single board overlay device tree
may applied to multiple soc device trees. The "model" property in soc device
tree is overwritten with board overlay device tree. So the final string in
"model" property can only contain Board information. And "qcom,msm-name"
and "qcom,pmic-name" property is introduced.

Optional properties:
- qcom,msm-name: The name string of MSM SoC chip
- qcom,pmic-name: The name string of MSM Pmic chip

Required properties:
- model: in soc device tree
	Contain the soc and pmic information.
	Will be overwritten by model string in board overlay device tree.
	It will be used in bootloader for debug purpose.
- model: in board overlay device tree
	Contain the board information. It is the final model string that
	kernel can see.

Note:
When device tree property qcom,msm-name and qcom,pmic-name exist, it will
use concatenated msm machine name string for final machine name.
When device tree property qcom,msm-name and qcom,pmic-name doesn't exist,
it will use model property string for final machine name.

Example:
* In soc device tree:
	/ {
		model = "Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. APQ 8953 + PMI8950 SOC";
		compatible = "qcom,apq8053";
		qcom,pmic-id = <0x010016 0x010011 0x0 0x0>;
		qcom,pmic-name = "PMI8950";
		qcom,msm-id = <293 0x0>;
		qcom,msm-name = "APQ8053";
	};
* In board overlay device tree:
	/ {
		model = "MTP";
		compatible = "qcom,mtp";
	};
