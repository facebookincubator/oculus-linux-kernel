Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM Clock controller

Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. MSM Clock controller devices contain PLLs, root clock
generators and other clocking hardware blocks that provide stable, low power
clocking to hardware blocks on Qualcomm Technologies SOCs. The clock controller
device node lists the power supplies needed to be scaled using the vdd_*-supply
property.

Minor differences between hardware revisions are handled in code by re-using
the compatible string to indicate the revision.

- reg:                  Pairs of physical base addresses and region sizes of
                        memory mapped registers.
- reg-names:            Names of the bases for the above registers. Currently,
                        there is one expected base: "cc_base". Optional
                        reg-names are "apcs_base", "meas", "mmss_base",
                        "lpass_base", "apcs_c0_base", "apcs_c1_base",
                        "apcs_cci_base", "efuse".

Optional properties:
- vdd_dig-supply:       The digital logic rail supply.
- <pll>_dig-supply:     Some PLLs might have separate digital supply on some
                        targets. These properties will be provided on those
                        targets for specific PLLs.
- <pll>_analog-supply:  Some PLLs might have separate analog supply on some
                        targets. These properties will be provided on those
                        targets for specific PLLs.
- vdd_gpu_mx-supply:    MX rail supply for the GPU core.
- #clock_cells:         If this device will also be providing controllable
                        clocks, the clock_cells property needs to be specified.
                        This will allow the common clock device tree framework
                        to recognize _this_ device node as a clock provider.
- qcom,<clk>-corner-<vers>: List of frequency voltage pairs that the clock can
                            operate at. Drivers can use the OPP library API to
                            operate on the list of OPPs registered using these
                            values.
- qcom,<clk>-speedbinX: A table of frequency (Hz) to voltage (corner) mapping
                        that represents the max frequency possible for each
                        supported voltage level for the clock.
                        'X' is the speed bin into which the device falls into -
                        a bin will have unique frequency-voltage relationships.
                        The value 'X' is read from efuse registers, and the right
                        table is picked from multiple possible tables.
- qcom,<clock-name>-opp-handle: phandle references to the devices for which OPP
                        table is filled with the clock frequency and voltage
                        values.
- qcom,<clock-name>-opp-store-vcorner: phandle references to the devices for
                        which OPP table is filled with the clock frequency
                         and voltage corner/level.

Example:
        clock_gcc: qcom,gcc@fc400000 {
                compatible = "qcom,gcc-8974";
                reg = <0xfc400000 0x4000>;
                reg-names = "cc_base";
                vdd_dig-supply = <&pm8841_s2_corner>;
                #clock-cells = <1>;
        };
