Qualcomm Application A7 CPU clock driver
-------------------------------------

It is the clock controller driver which provides higher frequency
clocks and allows A7 CPU frequency scaling on sdxpoorwills based platforms.

Required properties:
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
		"qcom,cpu-sdxpoorwills",
- clocks : Phandle to the clock device.
- clock-names: Names of the used clocks.
- qcom,a7cc-init-rate = Initial rate which needs to be set from cpu driver.
- reg : shall contain base register offset and size.
- reg-names : Names of the bases for the above registers.
- vdd_dig_ao-supply : The regulator powering the APSS PLL.
- cpu-vdd-supply : The regulator powering the APSS RCG.
- qcom,rcg-reg-offset : Register offset for APSS RCG.
- qcom,speedX-bin-vZ :	A table of CPU frequency (Hz) to regulator voltage (uV) mapping.
			Format: <freq uV>
			This represents the max frequency possible for each possible
			power configuration for a CPU that's binned as speed bin X,
			speed bin revision Z. Speed bin values can be between [0-7]
			and the version can be between [0-3].
- #clock-cells : shall contain 1.

Optional properties :
- reg-names: "efuse",

Example:
	clock_cpu: qcom,clock-a7@17808100 {
		compatible = "qcom,cpu-sdxpoorwills";
		clocks = <&clock_rpmh RPMH_CXO_CLK_A>;
		clock-names = "xo_ao";
		qcom,a7cc-init-rate = <1497600000>;
		reg = <0x17808100 0x7F10>;
		reg-names = "apcs_pll";

		vdd_dig_ao-supply = <&pmxpoorwills_s5_level_ao>;
		cpu-vdd-supply = <&pmxpoorwills_s5_level_ao>;
		qcom,rcg-reg-offset = <0x7F08>;
		qcom,speed0-bin-v0 =
			<          0 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_OFF>,
			<  345600000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_LOW_SVS>,
			<  576000000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_SVS>,
			< 1094400000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_NOM>,
			< 1497600000 RPMH_REGULATOR_LEVEL_TURBO>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
