Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. QPNP clock divider (clkdiv)

clkdiv configures the clock frequency of a set of outputs on the PMIC.
These clocks are typically wired through alternate functions on
gpio pins.

=======================
Supported Properties
=======================

- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: should be "qcom,qpnp-clkdiv".

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Addresses and sizes for the memory of this CLKDIV
		    peripheral.

- qcom,cxo-freq
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: The frequency of the crystal oscillator (CXO) clock in Hz.

- qcom,clkdiv-id
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Integer value specifies the hardware identifier of this
		    CLKDIV peripheral.

- qcom,clkdiv-init-freq
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Initial output frequency in Hz to configure for the CLKDIV
		    peripheral. The initial frequency value should be less than
		    or equal to CXO clock frequency and greater than or equal to
		    CXO_freq/64.
