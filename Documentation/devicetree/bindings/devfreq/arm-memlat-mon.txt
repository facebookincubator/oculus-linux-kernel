ARM CPU memory latency monitor device

arm-memlat-mon is a device that represents the use of the PMU in ARM cores
to measure the parameters for latency driven memory access patterns.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,arm-memlat-mon" or "qcom,arm-cpu-mon"
- qcom,cpulist:			List of CPU phandles to be monitored in a cluster
- qcom,target-dev:		The DT device that corresponds to this master port
- qcom,core-dev-table:		A mapping table of core frequency to a required bandwidth vote at the
				given core frequency.

Optional properties:
- qcom,cachemiss-ev:		The cache miss event that this monitor is supposed to measure.
				Defaults to 0x17 if not specified.
- qcom,inst-ev:			The instruction count event that this monitor is supposed to measure.
				Defaults to 0x08 if not specified.
- qcom,stall-cycle-ev:		The stall cycle count that this monitor is supposed to measure.
				Assumes 100% stall if not specified.


Example:
	qcom,arm-memlat-mon {
		compatible = "qcom,arm-memlat-mon";
		qcom,cpulist = <&CPU0 &CPU1>;
		qcom,target-dev = <&memlat0>;
		qcom,cachemiss-ev = <0x2A>;
		qcom,inst-ev = <0x08>;
		qcom,stall-cycle-ev = <0xE7>;
		qcom,core-dev-table =
			<  300000 1525>,
			<  499200 3143>,
			< 1881600 5859>;
	};
