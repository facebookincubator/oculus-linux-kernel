* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. VM  Watchdog

Watchdog timer is configured with bark and bite time interval.
If Virtual Machine fails to reset the counter during bark interval,
a bark interrupt (SPI) is send to the VM. Failing to respond to the
bark interrupt causes a bite, when counter reaches programmed
bite interval. The bite interrupt is routed to secure world, and
causes a system reset.

The device tree parameters are:

Required properties:

- compatible : "qcom,vm-wdt"
- reg : base offset and length of the register set.
- reg-names : names corresponding to each reg property value.
        "wdt-base" - physical base address of watchdog timer registers
- interrupts : should contain bark and bite irq numbers
- qcom,pet-time : Non zero time interval at which watchdog should be pet in ms.
- qcom,bark-time : Non zero timeout value for a watchdog bark in ms.


Example:

	qcom,vm-wdt@f9017000 {
		compatible = "qcom,vm-wdt";
		reg = <0x17980000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "wdt-base";
		interrupts = <0 3 0>, <0 4 0>;
		qcom,bark-time = <11000>;
		qcom,pet-time = <10000>;
	};
