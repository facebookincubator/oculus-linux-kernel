Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. REFGEN Regulator

Some Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SoCs utilize reference bias generators for
various internal PHY blocks.  These are called REFGENs.

Supported properties:
- compatible
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Must be "qcom,refgen-regulator".

- reg
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: Address and size of the REFGEN registers.

- regulator-name
	Usage:      required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Specifies the name for this REFGEN regulator.

- regulator-enable-ramp-delay
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: REFGEN enable time in microseconds.

- parent-supply
	Usage:      optional
	Value type: <phandle>
	Definition: phandle to the parent supply/regulator node if one exists.

Example:

refgen-regulator@ff1000 {
	compatible = "qcom,refgen-regulator";
	reg = <0xff1000 0x60>;
	regulator-name = "refgen";
};
