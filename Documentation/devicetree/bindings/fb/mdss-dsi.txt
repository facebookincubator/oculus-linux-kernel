Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. mdss-dsi

mdss-dsi is the master DSI device which supports multiple DSI host controllers that
are compatible with MIPI display serial interface specification.

Required properties:
- compatible:				Must be "qcom,mdss-dsi"
- hw-config:				Specifies the DSI host setup configuration
					"hw-config" = "single_dsi"
					"hw-config" = "dual_dsi"
					"hw-config" = "split_dsi"
- ranges:				The standard property which specifies the child address
					space, parent address space and the length.
- vdda-supply:				Phandle for vreg regulator device node.

Bus Scaling Data:
- qcom,msm-bus,name:		String property describing MDSS client.
- qcom, msm-bus,num-cases:	This is the number of bus scaling use cases
				defined in the vectors property. This must be
				set to <2> for MDSS DSI driver where use-case 0
				is used to remove BW votes from the system. Use
				case 1 is used to generate bandwidth requestes
				when sending command packets.
- qcom,msm-bus,num-paths:	This represents number of paths in each bus
				scaling usecase. This value depends on number of
				AXI master ports dedicated to MDSS for
				particular chipset.
- qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps:	A series of 4 cell properties, with a format
				of (src, dst, ab, ib) which is defined at
				Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt.
				DSI driver should always set average bandwidth
				(ab) to 0 and always use instantaneous
				bandwidth(ib) values.

Optional properties:
- vcca-supply:				Phandle for vcca regulator device node.
- qcom,<type>-supply-entries:		A node that lists the elements of the supply used by the
					a particular "type" of DSI modulee. The module "types"
					can be "core", "ctrl", and "phy". Within the same type,
					there can be more than one instance of this binding,
					in which case the entry would be appended with the
					supply entry index.
					e.g. qcom,ctrl-supply-entry@0
					-- qcom,supply-name: name of the supply (vdd/vdda/vddio)
					-- qcom,supply-min-voltage: minimum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-max-voltage: maximum voltage level (uV)
					-- qcom,supply-enable-load: load drawn (uA) from enabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-disable-load: load drawn (uA) from disabled supply
					-- qcom,supply-ulp-load: load drawn (uA) from supply in ultra-low power mode
					-- qcom,supply-pre-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning on
					-- qcom,supply-post-on-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning on
					-- qcom,supply-pre-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) before turning off
					-- qcom,supply-post-off-sleep: time to sleep (ms) after turning off
- pll-src-config			Specified the source PLL for the DSI
					link clocks:
					"PLL0" - Clocks sourced out of DSI PLL0
					"PLL1" - Clocks sourced out of DSI PLL1
					This property is only valid for
					certain DSI hardware configurations
					mentioned in the "hw-config" binding above.
					For example, in split_dsi config, the clocks can
					only be sourced out of PLL0. For
					dual_dsi, both PLL would be active.
					For single DSI, it is possible to
					select either PLL. If no value is specified,
					the default value for single DSI is set as PLL0.
- qcom,mmss-ulp-clamp-ctrl-offset:	Specifies the offset for dsi ulps clamp control register.
- qcom,mmss-phyreset-ctrl-offset:	Specifies the offset for dsi phy reset control register.
- qcom,dsi-clk-ln-recovery:		Boolean which enables the clk lane recovery
- qcom,mdss-skip-clamp:			Boolean which skip clamp for lanes.
