Qualcomm Technolgies, Inc.  mdss-qpic

mdss-qpic is a qpic controller device which supports dma transmission to MIPI
and LCDC panel.

Required properties:
- compatible:			must be "qcom,mdss_qpic"
- reg:					offset and length of the register set for the device.
- reg-names :			names to refer to register sets related to this device
- interrupts:			IRQ line
- vdd-supply:			Phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- avdd-supply:			Phandle for avdd regulator device node.
- qcom,cs-gpio:			Phandle for cs gpio device node.
- qcom,te-gpio:			Phandle for te gpio device node.
- qcom,rst-gpio:		Phandle for rst gpio device node.
- qcom,ad8-gpio:		Phandle for ad8 gpio device node.
- qcom,bl-gpio:			Phandle for backlight gpio device node.

Optional properties:
- Refer to "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/msm/msm_bus.txt" for
below Bus Scaling properties:
	- qcom,msm-bus,name
