- qcom,hdmi-tx-hpd: gpio required for HDMI hot-plug detect. Required on
  platforms where companion chip is not used.
- pinctrl-names: a list of strings that map to the pinctrl states.
- pinctrl-0: list of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration node.
...
- pinctrl-n: list of phandles, each pointing at a pin configuration node.
- qcom,conti-splash-enabled: Enables the hdmi continuous splash screen feature.
  HDMI interface will remain powered on from LK to kernel with continuous
  display of bootup logo.

		   The possible values are:
		   - "primary"
		   - "secondary"
		   - "tertiary"

[Optional child nodes]: These nodes are for devices which are
dependent on HDMI Tx controller. If HDMI Tx controller is disabled then
these devices will be disabled as well. Ex. HDMI Audio Codec device.

- qcom,msm-hdmi-audio-rx: Node for HDMI audio codec.
Required properties:
- compatible : "msm-hdmi-audio-codec-rx";
