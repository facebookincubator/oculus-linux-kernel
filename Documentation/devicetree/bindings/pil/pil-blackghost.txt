Qualcomm Technologies Inc Blackghost(BG) PIL driver:

Blackghost(BG) PIL driver provide interface to load and boot Blackghost(BG)
SOC. Blackghost(BG) SOC is an external SOC which communicate to MSM via
SPI. The PIL driver loads firmware into memory and invoke secure app via
qseecom to transfer and handshake the boot process. Once Blackghost(BG) SOC
is booted it raises ready interrupt which is handled by BG PIL driver, and
this event is informed to other MSM drivers, other remote subsystem via
notifier framework. The PIL driver also handles interrupt for the BG SOC
crash upon arrival of which it reset and initiates ramdump collection for BG
SOC.

Required properties:
- compatible:			Must be "qcom,PIL-blackghost"
- qcom,firmware-name:		Base name of the firmware image.
- qcom,bg2ap-status-gpio:	GPIO used by the blackghost to indicate status to the apps.
- qcom,bg2ap-errfatal-gpio:	GPIO used by the blackghost to indicate software error to the apps.
- qcom,ap2bg-status-gpio:	GPIO used by the apps to indicate its status to blackghost.
- qcom,ap2bg-errfatal-gpio:	GPIO used by the apps to indicate blackghost about apps reset.

Example:

	qcom,blackghost {
		compatible = "qcom,pil-blackghost";
		qcom,firmware-name = "bgelf";

		/* GPIO inputs from blackghost */
		qcom,bg2ap-status-gpio = <&msm_gpio 97 0>;
		qcom,bg2ap-errfatal-gpio = <&msm_gpio 95 0>;
		/* GPIO output to blackghost */
		qcom,ap2bg-status-gpio = <&msm_gpio 17 0>;
		qcom,ap2bg-errfatal-gpio = <&msm_gpio 23 0>;
	};
