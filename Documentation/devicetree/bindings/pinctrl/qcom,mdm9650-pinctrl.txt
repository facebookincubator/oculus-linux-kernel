QTI MDM9650 TLMM block

This binding describes the Top Level Mode Multiplexer block found in the
MDM9650 platform.

- compatible:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: must be "qcom,mdm9650-pinctrl"

- reg:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: the base address and size of the TLMM register space.

- interrupts:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
	Definition: should specify the TLMM summary IRQ.

- interrupt-controller:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: identifies this node as an interrupt controller

- #interrupt-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 2. Specifying the pin number and flags, as defined
		    in <dt-bindings/interrupt-controller/irq.h>

- gpio-controller:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: identifies this node as a gpio controller

- #gpio-cells:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: must be 2. Specifying the pin number and flags, as defined
		    in <dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h>

Please refer to ../gpio/gpio.txt and ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
a general description of GPIO and interrupt bindings.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

The pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
parameters, such as pull-up, drive strength, etc.


PIN CONFIGURATION NODES:

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content.

Each subnode only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed. In
other words, a subnode that lists a mux function but no pin configuration
parameters implies no information about any pin configuration parameters.
Similarly, a pin subnode that describes a pullup parameter implies no
information about e.g. the mux function.


The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pin configuration subnode:

- pins:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string-array>
	Definition: List of gpio pins affected by the properties specified in
		    this subnode.

- function:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Specify the alternative function to be configured for the
		    specified pins.

- bias-disable:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as no pull.

- bias-pull-down:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as pull down.

- bias-pull-up:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as pull up.

- output-high:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven
		    high.

- output-low:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven
		    low.

- drive-strength:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Selects the drive strength for the specified pins, in mA.

Example:

	tlmm_pinmux: pinctrl@1000000 {
		compatible = "qcom,mdm9650-pinctrl";
		reg = <0x1000000 0x300000>;
		interrupts = <0 208 0>;
		gpio-controller;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		interrupt-controller;
		#interrupt-cells = <2>;

		uart1_console_active: uart1_console_active {
			mux {
				pins = "gpio0", "gpio1";
				function = "blsp_uart1";
			};

			config {
				pins = "gpio0", "gpio1";
				drive-strength = <2>;
				bias-disable;
			};
		};
	};
