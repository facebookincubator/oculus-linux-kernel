Please refer to ../gpio/gpio.txt and ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt for
a general description of GPIO and interrupt bindings.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

The pin configuration nodes act as a container for an arbitrary number of
subnodes. Each of these subnodes represents some desired configuration for a
pin, a group, or a list of pins or groups. This configuration can include the
mux function to select on those pin(s)/group(s), and various pin configuration
parameters, such as pull-up, drive strength, etc.


PIN CONFIGURATION NODES:

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content.

Each subnode only affects those parameters that are explicitly listed. In
other words, a subnode that lists a mux function but no pin configuration
parameters implies no information about any pin configuration parameters.
Similarly, a pin subnode that describes a pullup parameter implies no
information about e.g. the mux function.


The following generic properties as defined in pinctrl-bindings.txt are valid
to specify in a pin configuration subnode:

- pins:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string-array>
	Definition: List of gpio pins affected by the properties specified in
		    this subnode.

		    Valid pins are:
		      gpio0-gpio149
		        Supports mux, bias and drive-strength

		      sdc1_clk, sdc1_cmd, sdc1_data sdc2_clk, sdc2_cmd,
		      sdc2_data sdc1_rclk
		        Supports bias and drive-strength

- function:
	Usage: required
	Value type: <string>
	Definition: Specify the alternative function to be configured for the
		    specified pins. Functions are only valid for gpio pins.
		    Valid values are:

		    qup0, qup9, qdss_cti, ddr_pxi0, ddr_bist, atest_tsens2,
		    vsense_trigger, atest_usb1, qup_l4, GP_PDM1, qup_l5,
		    mdp_vsync, qup_l6, wlan2_adc1, atest_usb11, ddr_pxi2,
		    edp_lcd, dbg_out, wlan2_adc0, atest_usb10, m_voc,
		    tsif1_sync, ddr_pxi3, cam_mclk, pll_bypassnl, qdss_gpio0,
		    pll_reset, qdss_gpio1, qdss_gpio2, qdss_gpio3, cci_i2c,
		    qup1, gpio

- bias-disable:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as no pull.

- bias-pull-down:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as pull down.

- bias-pull-up:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins should be configued as pull up.

- output-high:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven
		    high.
		    Not valid for sdc pins.

- output-low:
	Usage: optional
	Value type: <none>
	Definition: The specified pins are configured in output mode, driven
		    low.
		    Not valid for sdc pins.
