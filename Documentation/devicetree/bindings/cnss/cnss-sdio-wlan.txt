* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Connectivity SubSystem Platform Driver

This platform driver adds support for the CNSS subsystem used for SDIO
based Wi-Fi devices. It also adds support to manage two 1.8V voltage
regulators and WLAN power enable 3.3V regulators. The main purpose of this
device tree entry below is to invoke the CNSS SDIO platform driver
and provide handle to the WLAN power enable 3.3V pmic GPIO and two 1.8V
PMIC voltage regulator resources.

Required properties:
  - compatible: "qcom,cnss_sdio"
  - reg: memory resource to save firmware dump, optional.
  - reg-names: memory resource name.
  - subsys-name: cnss sdio subsytem device name, required.
  - vdd-wlan-supply: phandle to the WLAN vdd regulator device tree node.
  - vdd-wlan-dsrc-supply: phandle to the WLAN dsrc vdd regulator device tree node.
  - vdd-wlan-io-supply: phandle to the WLAN IO regulator device tree node.
  - vdd-wlan-xtal-supply: phandle to the WLAM XTAL regulator device tree node.

Optional properties:
  - pinctrl-names: Names corresponding to the numbered pinctrl states
  - pinctrl-<n>: Pinctrl states as described in
                bindings/pinctrl/pinctrl-bindings.txt
  - qcom,is-antenna-shared: Enabled for Platforms with both sdio and pcie QCA
                           Chipsets are attached.
  - qcom,cnss-enable-bus-bandwidth: Boolean - Define this property when target
					support to vote for bus bandwidth.
  - qcom,msm-bus,name: client name for msm bus register.
  - qcom,msm-bus,num-cases: number of cases for bus scaling.
  - qcom,msm-bus,num-paths: number of paths for bus scale vector.
  - qcom,msm-bus,vectors-KBps: bus scale vector table.
  - qcom,skip-wlan-en-toggle: Boolean property to be enabled for platforms where
                           wlan_en toggling is not supported.
  - vdd-wlan-xtal-min: Minimum required voltage in uV for VDD_XTAL regulator.
			   Minimum required voltage is 1620000.
			   If not set, a typical 1800000 will be set.
  - vdd-wlan-xtal-max: Maximum acceptable voltage in uV for VDD_XTAL regulator.
			   Maximum acceptable voltage is 3465000.
			   If not set, a typical 1800000 will be set.
